## Information:
1. The name of each image file serves as the name and alias of the custom emoji when it is uploaded to Rocket chat.
2. The name and alias are both required fields to add a custom emoji.
3. Each emoji is thus named `name_alias` i.e. the name and alias are separated by a `_` (underscore).
4. The name and alias both can have multiple words, and these words and separated by a `-` (hyphen-minus).


## Guidelines for making changes:
1. The first half (separated by `_`) is the name (eg, woman-wave_girl-wave.png --> name: woman-wave, alias: girl-wave).
2. The second half is the alias.
3. Please do not include `_` in the name or alias. Separate words in the name and alias using `-`.
