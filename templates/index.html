<h2>Introduction</h2>
Deep Learning models are at the core of research in Artificial Intelligence research today. It is well-known that deep learning techniques that were disruptive for Euclidean data (e.g.,images) and sequence data (e.g., texts) are not immediately applicable to graph-structured data. This gap has driven a tide in research for deep learning on graphs for various tasks such as graph representation learning, classification, and generation. In recent years, a large number of neural network architectures on graph-structured data have been developed and achieved remarkable performance in these tasks when applied to domains such as social networks, bioinformatics, and medical informatics.
<br>
Furthermore, this wave of research at the intersection of graph theory and deep learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, inductive logic programming, program synthesis and analysis, automated planning, reinforcement learning, and cyber security. Although deep learning on graphs has achieved remarkable attention, it faces many challenges when applying them into other domains, from the soundness of the methodology to the empirical performance.
<br>
In this book, we would like to cover a broad range of the topics in deep learning on graphs, namely graph neural networks (GNNs), from methodologies to applications, and from foundations to the new frontiers of GNNs. Although there are a few existing books that touch some relevant topics, they cannot comprehensively cover the fast-growing area of GNNs where new techniques and applications constantly emerge. For instance, there are books on basic techniques on graph neural networks, graph representation learning (including network embedding and graph neural networks), and foundations on graph learning and fundamental methods in GNNs. However, there is no such a book which is dedicated to introducing both the fundamental concepts,algorithms of GNNs, and new frontiers of GNNs.
<br>
Therefore, we feel the urgency to bridge the above gap and have a comprehensive edited book on this fast growing yet challenging topic, which can benefit a broad audience including advanced undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, lecturers, and industrial practitioners.
