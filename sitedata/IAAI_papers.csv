IAAI-17,TOOL,HetSeq: Distributed GPU Training on Heterogeneous Infrastructure,Yifan Ding|Nicholas Botzer|Tim Weninger,"Modern deep learning systems like PyTorch and Tensorflow are able to train enormous models with billions (or trillions) of parameters on a distributed infrastructure. These systems require that the internal nodes have the same memory capacity and compute performance. Unfortunately, most organizations, especially universities, have a piecemeal approach to purchasing computer systems resulting in a heterogeneous infrastructure, which cannot be used to compute large models. The present work describes HetSeq, a software package adapted from the popular PyTorch package that provides the capability to train large neural network models on heterogeneous infrastructure. Experiments with language translation, text and image classification shows that HetSeq scales over heterogeneous systems. Additional information, support documents, source code are publicly available at https://github.com/yifding/hetseq.",38951107,38951153,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-17.DingY.pdf,6-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D3-B,B,1,AI,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-17
IAAI-21,EMERGING,JEL: Applying End-to-End Neural Entity Linking in JPMorgan Chase,Wanying Ding|Vinay K. Chaudhri|Naren Chittar|Krihshna Konakanchi,"Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for capturing key relationship among the entities of interest to enterprises and for integrating data from heterogeneous sources. JPMorgan Chase (JPMC) is leading this trend by leveraging knowledge graphs across the organization for multiple mission critical applications such as risk assessment, fraud detection, investment advice, etc. A core problem in leveraging a knowledge graph is to link mentions (e.g., company names) that are encountered in textual sources to entities in the knowledge graph. Although several techniques exist for entity linking, they are tuned for entities that exist in Wikipedia, and fail to generalize for the entities that are of interest to an enterprise. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end neural entity linking model (JEL) that uses minimal context information and a margin loss to generate entity embeddings, and a Wide & Deep Learning model to match character and semantic information respectively. We show that JEL achieves the state-of-the-art performance to link mentions of company names in financial news with entities in our knowledge graph. We report on our efforts to deploy this model in the company-wide system to generate alerts in response to financial news. The methodology used for JEL is directly applicable and usable by other enterprises who need entity linking solutions for data that are unique to their respective situations.",38951108,38951154,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-21.DingW.pdf,5-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D2-B,B,1,knowledge,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-21
IAAI-23,DEPLOYED,Enhancing E-commerce Recommender System Adaptability with Online Deep Controllable Learning-to-Rank,Anxiang Zeng|Han Yu|Hualin He|Yabo Ni|Yongliang Li|Jingren Zhou|Chunyan Miao,"In the past decade, recommender systems for e-commerce have witnessed significant advancement. Recommendation scenarios can be divided into different type (e.g., pre-, during-, post-purchase, campaign, promotion, bundle) for different user groups or different businesses. For different scenarios, the goals of recommendation are different. This is reflected by the different performance metrics employed. In addition, online promotional campaigns, which attract high traffic volumes, are also a critical factor affecting e-commerce recommender systems. Typically, prior to a promotional campaign, the Add-to-Cart Rate (ACR) is the target of optimization. During the campaign, this changes to Gross Merchandise Volumes (GMV). Immediately after the campaign, it becomes Click Through Rates CTR. Dynamically adapting among these potentially conflicting optimization objectives is an important capability for recommender systems deployed in real-world e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we report our experience designing and deploying the Deep Controllable Learning-To-Rank (DC-LTR) recommender system to address this challenge. It enhances the feedback controller in LTR with multi-objective optimization so as to maximize different objectives under constraints. Its ability to dynamically adapt to changing business objectives has resulted in significant business advantages. Since September 2019, DC-LTR has become a core service enabling adaptive online training and real-time deployment ranking models based on changing business objectives in AliExpress and Lazada. Under both everyday use scenarios and peak load scenarios during large promotional campaigns, DC-LTR has achieved significant improvements in satisfying real-world business objectives.",38951109,38951155,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-23.ZengA.pdf,4-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D1-A,A,4,commerce,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-23
IAAI-31,CHALLENGE,Preventing Repeated Real World AI Failures by Cataloging Incidents: The AI Incident Database,Sean McGregor,"Mature industrial sectors (e.g., aviation) collect their real world failures in incident databases to inform safety improvements. Intelligent systems currently cause real world harms without a collective memory of their failings. As a result, companies repeatedly make the same mistakes in the design, development, and deployment of intelligent systems. A collection of intelligent system failures experienced in the real world (i.e., incidents) is needed to ensure intelligent systems benefit people and society. The AI Incident Database is an incident collection initiated by an industrial/non-profit cooperative to enable AI incident avoidance and mitigation.

Flohr,"We present a fast and efficient approach for joint person detection and pose estimation optimized for automated driving (AD) in urban scenarios. We use a multitask weight sharing architecture to jointly train detection and pose estimation. This modular architecture allows us to accommodate different downstream tasks in the future. By systematic large-scale experiments on the Tsinghua-Daimler Urban Pose Dataset (TDUP), we obtain multiple models with varying accuracy-speed trade-offs. We then quantize and optimize our network for deployment and present a detailed analysis of the efficacy of the algorithm. We introduce a two-stage evaluation strategy, which is more suitable for AD and achieve a significant performance improvement in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. Our optimized model runs at 52~fps on full HD images and still reaches a competitive performance of 32.25~LAMR. We are confident that our work serves as an enabler to tackle higher-level tasks like VRU intention estimation and gesture recognition, which rely on stable pose estimates and will play a crucial role in future AD systems.",38951111,38951157,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-34.KumarC.pdf,6-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D3-D,D,3,driving,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-34

We show how this grammar can serve as a unification layer on top of different featurization techniques, and their hybridization thereof. The approach is embodied in an open-source library, called TextWiser, with a high-level user interface to serve researchers and practitioners. The goal of TextWiser is to enable rapid experimentation with various featurization methods and to serve as a building block within AI applications consuming unstructured data. We highlight several key benefits that are desirable especially in industrial settings where rapid experimentation, reusability, reproducibility, and time to market are of great interest.

IAAI-55,EMERGING,Predicting Mining Industry Accidents with a Multi-Task Learning Approach,Rodolfo Palma|Luis Martí|Nayat Sanchez-Pi,"The mining sector is a very relevant part of the  Chilean economy, representing more than 14\% of the country’s GDP and more than 50\% of its exports. However, mining is also a high-risk activity where health, safety, and environmental aspects are fundamental concerns to take into account to render it viable in the longer term. The Chilean National Geology and Mining Service (SERNAGEOMIN, after its name in Spanish) is in charge of ensuring the safe operation of mines. On-site inspections are their main tool in order to detect issues, propose corrective measures, and track the compliance of those measures.  Consequently, it is necessary to create inspection programs relying on a data-based decision-making strategy.        This paper reports the work carried out in one of the most relevant dimensions of said strategy: predicting the mining worksites accident risk. That is, how likely it is a mining worksite to have accidents in the future. This risk is then used to create a priority ranking that is used to devise the inspection program. Estimating this risk at the government regulator level is particularly challenging as there is a very limited and biased data.        Our main contribution is to apply a multi-task learning approach to train the risk prediction model in such a way that is able to overcome the constraints of the limited availability of data by fusing different sources. As part of this work, we also implemented a human-experience-based model that captures the procedures currently used by the current experts in charge of elaborating the inspection priority ranking.        The mining worksites risk rankings built by model achieve a 121.2% NDCG performance improvement over the rankings based on the currently used experts’ model and outperforms the non-multi-task learning alternatives.",38951114,38951160,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-55.PalmaR.pdf,5-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D2-D,D,3,prediction,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-55

Kolaitis|Chuan Lei|Fatma Ozcan|Lucian Popa,"We develop a flexible, open-source framework for query answering on relational databases by adopting methods and techniques from the Semantic Web community and the data exchange community, and we apply this framework to a medical use case. We first deploy module-extraction techniques to derive a concise and relevant sub-ontology from an external reference ontology. We then use the chase procedure from the data exchange community to materialize a universal solution that can be subsequently used to answer queries on an enterprise medical database. Along the way, we identify a new class of well-behaved acyclic EL-ontologies extended with role hierarchies, suitably restricted functional roles, and domain/range restrictions, which cover our use case. We show that such ontologies are C-stratified, which implies that the chase procedure terminates in polynomial time. We provide a detailed overview of our real-life application in the medical domain and demonstrate the benefits of this approach, such as discovering additional answers and formulating new queries.",38951115,38951161,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-59.AhmetajS.pdf,5-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D2-B,B,2,knowledge,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-59
IAAI-60,EMERGING,Finding Needles in Heterogeneous Haystacks,Bijaya Adhikari|Liangyue Li|Nikhil Rao|Karthik Subbian,"Due to intense competition and lack of real estate on the front page of large e-commerce platforms, sellers are sometimes motivated to garner non-genuine signals (clicks, add-to-carts, purchases) on their products, to make them appear more appealing to customers. This hurts customers' trust on the platform, and also hurts genuine sellers who sell their items without looking to game the system. While it is important to find the sellers and the buyers who are colluding to garner these non-genuine signals, doing so is highly nontrivial. Firstly, the set of bad actors in the system is a very small fraction of all the buyers/sellers on the platform. Secondly, bad actors ``hide"" with the good ones, making them hard to detect. In this paper, we develop CONGCN, a context aware heterogeneous graph convolutional network to detect bad actors on a large heterogeneous graph. While our method is motivated by abuse detection in e-commerce, the method is applicable to other areas such as computational biology and finance, where large heterogeneous graphs are pervasive, and the amount of labeled data is very limited. We train CONGCN via novel sampling methods, and context aware message passing in a semi-supervised fashion to predict dishonest buyers and sellers in e-commerce. Extensive experiments show that our method is effective, beating several baselines; generalizable to an inductive setting and highly scalable",38951116,38951162,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-60.AdhikariB.pdf,6-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D3-A,A,1,AI,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-60
IAAI-65,CHALLENGE,Empirical Best Practices on Using Product-Specific Schema.org,Mayank Kejriwal|Ravi Kiran Selvam|Chien-Chun Ni|Nicolas Torzec,"Schema.org has experienced high growth in recent years. Structured descriptions of products embedded in HTML pages are now not uncommon, especially on e-commerce websites. The Web Data Commons (WDC) project has extracted schema.org data at scale from webpages in the Common Crawl and made it available as an RDF `knowledge graph' at scale. The portion of this data that specifically describes products offers a golden opportunity for researchers and small companies to leverage it for analytics and downstream applications. Yet, because of the broad and expansive scope of  this data, it is not evident whether the data is usable in its raw form. In this paper, we do a detailed empirical study on the product-specific schema.org data made available by WDC. Rather than simple analysis, the goal of our study is to devise an empirically grounded set of best practices for using and consuming WDC product-specific schema.org data. Our studies reveal five best practices, each of which is justified by experimental data and analysis.",38951117,38951163,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-65.KejriwalM.pdf,5-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D2-C,C,2,knowledge,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-65

While a large-size deeper model could provide competitive accuracy, it creates a lot of logistical challenges and unreasonable resource requirements during development and deployment. This has been one of the key reasons for deep learning models not being excessively used in various production environments, especially in edge devices. There is an immediate requirement for optimizing and compressing these deep learning models, to enable on-device intelligence. In this research, we introduce a black-box framework, Deeplite Neutrino^{TM} for production-ready optimization of deep learning models. The framework provides an easy mechanism for the end-users to provide constraints such as a tolerable drop in accuracy or target size of the optimized models, to guide the whole optimization process. The framework is easy to include in an existing production pipeline and is available as a Python Package, supporting PyTorch and Tensorflow libraries. The optimization performance of the framework is shown across multiple benchmark datasets and popular deep learning models. Further, the framework is currently used in production and the results and testimonials from several clients are summarized.",38951118,38951164,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-73.SankaranA.pdf,6-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D3-A,A,2,AI,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-73

These events can havesignificant impacts on human activity, many of which can be mitigatedwith enough advance warning from good forecasts.  To date, machinelearning-based flare-prediction methods have employed physics-basedattributes of the AR images as features; more recently, there has beensome work that uses features deduced automatically by deep learningmethods (such as convolutional neural networks).  We describe a suiteof novel shape-based features extracted from magnetogram images of theSun using the tools of computational topology and computationalgeometry.  We evaluate these features in the context of a multi-layerperceptron (MLP) neural network and compare their performance againstthe traditional physics-based attributes.

IAAI-76,EMERGING,Identification of Abnormal States in Videos of Ants Undergoing Social Phase Change,Taeyeong Choi|Benjamin Pyenson|Juergen Liebig|Theodore P. Pavlic,"Biology is both an important application area and a source of motivation for development of advanced machine learning techniques. Although much attention has been paid to large and complex data sets resulting from high-throughput sequencing, advances in high-quality video recording technology have begun to generate similarly rich data sets requiring sophisticated techniques from both computer vision and time-series analysis. Moreover, just as studying gene expression patterns in one organism can reveal general principles that apply to other organisms, the study of complex social interactions in an experimentally tractable model system, such as a laboratory ant colony, can provide general principles about the dynamics of other social groups. Here, we focus on one such example from the study of reproductive regulation in small laboratory colonies of more than 50 Harpegnathos ants. These ants can be artificially induced to begin a ~20 day process of hierarchy reformation. Although the conclusion of this process is conspicuous to a human observer, it remains unclear which behaviors during the transient period are contributing to the process. To address this issue, we explore the potential application of One-class Classification (OC) to the detection of abnormal states in ant colonies for which behavioral data is only available for the normal societal conditions during training. Specifically, we build upon the Deep Support Vector Data Description (DSVDD) and introduce the Inner-Outlier Generator (IO-GEN) that synthesizes fake “inner outlier” observations during training that are near the center of the DSVDD data description.We show that IO-GEN increases the reliability of the final OC classifier relative to other DSVDD baselines. This method can be used to screen video frames for which additional human observation is needed. Although we focus on an application with laboratory colonies of social insects, this approach may be applied to video data from other social systems to either better understand the causal factors behind social phase transitions or even to predict the onset of future transitions.",38951120,38951166,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-76.ChoiT.pdf,6-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D3-B,B,2,bioscience,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-76
IAAI-77,EMERGING,"Where There's Smoke, There's Fire: Wildfire Risk Predictive Modeling via Historical Climate Data",Shahrzad Gholami|Narendran Kodandapani|Jane Wang|Juan M. Lavista Ferres,"Wildfire is a growing global crisis with devastating consequences. Uncontrolled wildfires take away human lives, destroy millions of animals and trees, degrade the air quality, impact the biodiversity of the planet and cause substantial economic costs. It is incredibly challenging to predict the spatio-temporal likelihood of wildfires based on historical data, due to their stochastic nature. Crucially though, the accurate and reliable prediction of wildfires can help the stakeholders and decision-makers take timely, strategic and effective actions to prevent, detect and suppress the wildfires before they become unmanageable. Unfortunately, most previous studies developed predictive models that suffer from some shortcomings: (i) they do not take the temporal aspects into account precisely and they assume the independent and identically distributed random variables in the evaluation phase; (ii) they do not evaluate their approaches comprehensively, thus it is not clear if their proposed predictions and selected models are reliable across different locations and time steps for practical deployment; and (iii) for the supervised learning models, they use predictor features and fire observations from the same time step in the training phase, which makes the inference task infeasible for future fire prediction. In this paper, we revisit the wildfire predictive modeling, explore the inherent challenges from a practical perspective and evaluate our modeling approach comprehensively via historical burned areas, climate and geospatial data from three vast landscapes in India.",38951121,38951167,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-77.GholamiS.pdf,6-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D3-B,B,3,bioscience,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-77

Unlike many other EaaS tools that focus primarily on fixed sample A/B testing, Comparison Lift deploys a custom bandit-based experimentation algorithm. The advantages of the bandit-based approach are two-fold. First, it aligns the randomization induced in the test with the advertiser’s goals from testing. Second, by adapting experimental design to information acquired during the test, it reduces substantially the cost of experimentation to the advertiser. Since launch in May 2019, Comparison Lift has been utilized in over 1,500 experiments. We estimate that utilization of the product has helped increase click-through rates of participating advertising campaigns by 46% on average.

It dictates the delivery frequency of recommendations to maintain product quality and efficiency. For example, the frequency of delivering promotional notifications impacts daily metrics as well as the infrastructure resource consumption (e.g. CPU and memory usage). There remain open questions on what objective we should optimize to represent business values in the long term best, and how we should balance between daily metrics and resource consumption in a dynamically fluctuating environment. We propose a personalized methodology for the frequency control problem, which combines long-term value optimization using reinforcement learning (RL) with a robust volume control technique we termed ""Effective Factor"". We demonstrate statistically significant improvement in daily metrics and resource efficiency by our method in several notification applications at a scale of billions of users.

J. Staar,"The number of published PDF documents in both the academic and commercial world has increased exponentially in recent decades. There is a growing need to make their rich content discoverable to information retrieval tools. Achieving high-quality semantic searches demands that a document's structural components such as title, section headers, paragraphs, (nested) lists, tables and figures (including their captions) are properly identified. Unfortunately, the PDF format is known to not conserve such structural information because it simply represents a document as a stream of low-level printing commands, in which one or more characters are placed in a bounding box with a particular styling. In this paper, we present a novel approach to document structure recovery in PDF using recurrent neural networks to process the low-level PDF data representation directly, instead of relying on a visual re-interpretation of the rendered PDF page, as has been proposed in previous literature. We demonstrate how a sequence of PDF printing commands can be used as input into a neural network and how the network can learn to classify each printing command according to its structural function in the page. This approach has three advantages: First, it can distinguish among more fine-grained labels (typically 10-20 labels as opposed to 1-5 with visual methods), which results in a more accurate and detailed document structure resolution. Second, it can take into account the text flow across pages more naturally compared to visual methods because it can concatenate the printing commands of sequential pages. Last, our proposed method needs less memory and it is computationally less expensive than visual methods. This allows us to deploy such models in production environments at a much lower cost. Through extensive architectural search in combination with advanced feature engineering, we were able to implement a model that yields a weighted average F1 score of 97% across 17 distinct structural labels. The best model we achieved is currently served in production environments on our Corpus Conversion Service (CCS), which was presented at KDD18. This  model enhances the capabilities of CCS significantly, as it eliminates the  need for human annotated label ground-truth for every unseen document layout. This proved particularly useful when applied  to a huge corpus of PDF articles related to COVID-19.",38951124,38951170,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-89.LivathinosN.pdf,5-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D2-D,D,1,NLP,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-89

The goal of this work is to automatically explore potential payroll policies and find the optimal set of policies that satisfies the user's needs. To achieve this goal, we overcome two major challenges. First, we translate the tax legislative knowledge into a formal representation flexible enough to support a variety of scenarios in payroll calculations. Second, the legal knowledge is further compiled into a set of constraints from which a constraint solver can find the optimal policy. Furthermore, payroll computation is performed on the individual basis which might be expensive for companies with a large number of employees.

Once the vendor raises an invoice, it undergoes through a complex process before the final payment. In this process, tax code determination is one of the most challenging steps, which determines the tax to be levied and directly influences the amount payable to a vendor. This step is also very important from a regulatory compliance standpoint. However, it is error-prone, labor (resource) intensive, and needs regular training of the resources as it is done manually. Further, an error in the tax code determination induces penalties on the organization. Automatically arriving at a tax-code for a given product accurately and efficiently is a daunting task. To address this problem, we present an automated end-to-end system for tax code determination which can either be used as a standalone application or can be integrated into an existing invoice processing workflow. The proposed system determines the most relevant tax code for an invoice using attributes such as item description, vendor details, shipping and delivery location. The system has been deployed in production for a multinational consumer goods company for more than 6 months. It has already processed more than 22k items with an accuracy of more than 94% and high confidence prediction accuracy of around 99.54%.

IAAI-98,EMERGING,A Novel AI-Based Methodology for Identifying Cyber Attacks in Honey Pots,Muhammed AbuOdeh|Christian Adkins|Omid Setayeshfar|Prashant Doshi|Kyu H. Lee,"We present a novel AI-based methodology that identifies phases of a host-level cyber attack simply from system call logs. System calls emanating from cyber attacks on hosts such as honey pots are often recorded in audit logs. Our methodology first involves efficiently loading, caching, processing, and querying system events contained in audit logs in support of computer forensics. Output of queries remains at the system call level and is difficult to process. The next step is to infer a sequence of abstracted actions, which we colloquially call a storyline, from the system calls given as observations to a latent-state probabilistic model. These storylines are then accurately identified with class labels using a learned classifier. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate methods and models for each step of the methodology using 114 different attack phases collected by logging the attacks of a red team on a server, on some likely benign sequences containing regular user activities, and on traces from a recent DARPA project.

These channels are becoming important avenues for Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) %Subject Matter Experts (SME) to collaboratively work together to resolve an incident or issue. Identifying segmented conversations and extracting key insights or artefacts from them can help engineers to improve the efficiency of the incident remediation process by using information retrieval mechanisms for similar  incidents.  However, it has been empirically observed that due to the semi-formal behavior of such conversations (human language) the conversations are very unique in nature and also contain domain-specific terms. %It is important to identify the correct keywords and artefacts like symptoms, issue etc., present in the conversation chats. In this paper, we build a framework that taps into the conversational channels and uses various learning methods to (1) understand and extract key artefacts from conversations like diagnostic steps and resolution actions taken and (2) present an approach to identify past conversations about similar issues.

The database of historical and novel technical drawings thus represents the knowledge that is core to their operations. With current methods, however, utilizing these drawings is mostly a manual and time consuming effort. In this work, we present a software tool that knows how to interpret various parts of the drawing and can translate this information to allow for automatic reasoning and machine  learning  on top of such a large database of technical drawings. For example, to find erroneous designs, to learn about patterns present in successful designs, etc. To achieve this, we propose a method that automatically learns a parser capable of interpreting technical drawings, using only limited expert interaction. The proposed method makes use of both neural methods and symbolic  methods.  Neural methods to interpret visual images and recognize parts of two-dimensional drawings. Symbolic methods to deal with the relational structure and understand the data encapsulated in complex tables present in the technical drawing. Furthermore, the output can be used, for example, to build a similarity based search algorithm. We showcase one deployed tool that is used to help engineers find relevant, previous designs more easily as they can now query the database using a partial design instead of through limited and tedious keyword searches.

A widespread provision of parking assistance to address this problem requires a scalable system to generate availability information. Existing approaches to estimate the availability of parking spaces use supervised learning and depend on ground-truth labeling processes involving sensors or manual data collection. This dependency constraints the widespread roll-out and operation of such systems as the ground-truth data collection for model training, monitoring and retraining is prohibitively expensive. We describe a parking availability prediction system for paid on-street parking zones that does not depend on costly ground-truth labeling. The new approach uses solely data from parking ticket bookings via a mobile phone app. Every parking transaction serves as an implicit signal for the availability of one parking spot shortly before the booking. The system leverages this weak supervision signal by applying algorithms and metrics for positive-unlabeled learning (PU-learning). This approach enables the deployment in diverse regions, as well as the scalable monitoring and retraining of models.

The fabrication procedures for these devices involve screening or designing the right set of materials and then subjecting them to a sequence of operations under very specific conditions. The performance characteristics of a device critically depend on the materials used in its fabrication, the specific operations carried out, their operating conditions and the specific sequence in which they are carried out. The space of potential materials, operations and operating conditions is vast, and selecting the right combination thereof to achieve the desired characteristics is a knowledge intensive activity. A large amount of such device fabrication knowledge is available in the form of publications, patents, company reports and so on. In this paper, we present a system that systematically extracts this knowledge from materials science literature. The extracted knowledge is represented as knowledge graphs conforming to an ontology that can be queried to make informed decisions in device fabrication procedures. The system first identifies the set of relevant paragraphs that contain fabrication knowledge. It then employs state of the art entity and relation extraction models to identify instances of operations, methods, materials, etc. and relations between them. The system then applies an unsupervised algorithm to identify sequences of operations representing fabrication procedures.

The actuary and underwriter roles at a health insurance company serve to assess which risks to take on and how to price those risks to ensure profitability of the organization.  While Bayesian hierarchical models are the current standard in the industry to estimate risk, interest in machine learning as a way to improve upon these existing methods is increasing. Lumiata, a healthcare analytics company, ran a study with a large health insurance company in the United States.  We evaluated the ability of machine learning models to predict the per member per month cost of employer groups in their next renewal period, especially those groups who will cost less than 95\% of what an actuarial model predicts (groups with ""concession opportunities""). We developed a sequence of two models, an individual patient-level and an employer-group-level model, to predict the annual per member per month allowed amount for employer groups, based on a population of 14 million patients. Our models performed 20\% better than the insurance carrier's existing pricing model, and identified 84\% of the concession opportunities. This study demonstrates the application of a machine learning system to compute an accurate and fair price for health insurance products and analyzes how explainable machine learning models can exceed actuarial models' predictive accuracy while maintaining interpretability.",38951135,38951181,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-124.KshirsagarR.pdf,6-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D3-C,C,1,bioscience,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-124

In the domain of eCommerce, identifying the key entities, such as brand and product type, can help a search engine retrieve relevant products and therefore offer an engaging shopping experience. Recent research shows promising results on shared benchmark NER tasks using deep learning methods, but there are still unique challenges in the industry regarding domain knowledge, training data, and model production. This paper demonstrates an end-to-end solution to address these challenges. The core of our solution is a novel model training framework ”TripleLearn” which iteratively learns from three separate training datasets, instead of one training set as is traditionally done. Using this approach, the best model lifts the F1 score from 69.5 to 93.3 on the holdout test data. In our offline experiments, TripleLearn improved the model performance compared to traditional training approaches which use a single set of training data. Moreover, in the online A/B test, we see significant improvements in user engagement and revenue conversion. The model has been live on homedepot.com for more than 9 months, boosting search conversions and revenue. Beyond our application, this TripleLearn framework, as well as the end-to-end process, is model-independent and problem-independent, so it can be generalized to more industrial applications, especially to the eCommerce industry which has similar data foundations and problems.",38951137,38951183,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-140.ChengX.pdf,4-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D1-C,C,4,commerce,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-140

With historical ranger patrol records, it is possible to provide data-driven predictions of poaching threats and plan patrols to combat poaching. However, the patrollers often patrol in a multimodal way, which combines driving and walking. It is a tedious task for the domain experts to manually plan such a patrol and as a result, the planned patrol routes are often far from optimal. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach for multimodal patrol planning. We first use machine learning models to predict the poaching threats and then use a novel mixed-integer linear programming-based algorithm to plan the patrol route. In a field test focusing on the machine learning prediction result at Jilin Huangnihe National Nature Reserve (HNHR) in December 2019, the rangers found 42 snares, which is significantly higher than the historical record.

The quality of forecasting is subject to the model accuracy for complex transmission dynamics under varying conditions. However, it is almost infeasible to design a single physical model to capture all complex dynamics in epidemiological transmission. A mixture model that integrates many epidemiological models is a potential solution; however, it is very difficult to build an accurate yet efficient mixture model using conventional approaches. To address this issue, we propose a novel deep learning approach using black-box knowledge distillation for both accurate and practical transmission dynamics prediction. First, we develop a simulation system consisting of many mixture models with different parameters. Next, we use simulated observation sequences to query the simulation system to achieve simulated projection sequences as knowledge. To improve query efficiency and model accuracy, sequence mixup is proposed to reduce model queries and improve distillation accuracy. Then, we train a student deep neural network with the retrieved and mixed observation-projection sequences.

The trend suggests the deployment of the PV systems will continue to rise in the future. Thus, accurate forecasting of PV performance measure is critical for the reliability of PV systems. Due to complex non-linear variability in power output of the PV systems, forecasting PV power is a non-trivial task. The variability affects the stability and planning of a power system network, and accurate forecasting of the performance of the PV system can reduce the uncertainty caused during PV operation. In this work, we leverage spatial and temporal coherence among the power plants for PV power forecasting. Our approach is motivated by the observation that power plants in a region undergo similar environmental exposure. Thus, one power plant’s performance can help improve the forecast of other power plants’ power values in the region. We utilize the relationship between PV plants to build a spatiotemporal graph neural network (st-GNN) and train machine learning models to forecast the PV power. The computational experiments on large-scale data from a network of 316 systems show that spatiotemporal forecasting of PV power performs significantly better than a model that only applies temporal convolution to isolated nodes.

IAAI-176,EMERGING,Topological Machine Learning Methods for Power System Responses to Contingencies,Brian Bush|Yuzhou Chen|Dorcas Ofori-Boateng|Yulia R. Gel,"While deep learning tools, coupled with the emerging machinery of topological data analysis, are proven to deliver various performance gains in a broad range of applications, from image classification to biosurveillance to blockchain fraud detection, their utility in areas of high societal importance such as power system modeling and, particularly, resilience quantification in the energy sector yet remains untapped. To provide fast acting synthetic regulation and contingency reserve services to the grid while having minimal disruptions on customer quality of service, we propose a new topology-based system that depends on a neural network architecture for impact metric classification and prediction in power systems. This novel topology-based system allows one to evaluate the impact of three power system contingency types, in conjunction with transmission lines, transformers, and transmission lines combined with transformers. We show that the proposed new neural network architecture equipped with local topological measures facilitates more accurate classification of unserved load as well as the amount of unserved load. In addition, we are able to learn more about the complex relationships between electrical properties and local topological measurements on their simulated response to contingencies for the NREL-SIIP power system.",38951150,38951196,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-176.BushB.pdf,5-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D2-A,A,4,engineering,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-176
IAAI-179,EMERGING,Attr2Style: A Transfer Learning Approach for Inferring Fashion Styles via Apparel Attributes,Rajdeep Hazra Banerjee|Abhinav Ravi|Ujjal Kr Dutta,"Popular fashion e-commerce platforms mostly provide details about low-level attributes of an apparel (for example, neck type, dress length, collar type, print etc) on their product detail pages. However, customers usually prefer to buy apparel based on their style information, or simply put, occasion (for example, party wear, sports wear, casual wear etc). Application of a supervised image-captioning model to generate style-based image captions is limited because obtaining ground-truth annotations in the form of style-based captions is difficult. This is because annotating style-based captions requires a certain amount of fashion domain expertise, and also adds to the costs and manual effort. On the contrary, low-level attribute based annotations are much more easily available. To address this issue, we propose a transfer-learning based image captioning model that is trained on a source dataset with sufficient attribute-based ground-truth captions, and used to predict style-based captions on a target dataset. The target dataset has only a limited amount of images with style-based ground-truth captions. The main motivation of our approach comes from the fact that most often there are correlations among the low-level attributes and the higher-level styles for an apparel. We leverage this fact and train our model in an encoder-decoder based framework using attention mechanism. In particular, the encoder of the model is first trained on the source dataset to obtain latent representations capturing the low-level attributes. The trained model is fine-tuned to generate style-based captions for the target dataset. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the captions generated by our approach are close to the actual style information for the evaluated apparel. A Proof Of Concept (POC) for our model is under pilot at Myntra (www.myntra.com) where it is exposed to some internal users for feedback.",38951151,38951197,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-179.BanerjeeRH.pdf,4-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D1-B,B,3,commerce,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-179
IAAI-190,DEPLOYED,Using Unsupervised Learning for Data-Driven Procurement Demand Aggregation,Eran Shaham|Adam Westerski|Rajaraman Kanagasabai|Amudha Narayanan|Samuel Ong|Jiayu Wong|Manjeet Singh,"Procurement is an essential operation of every organization regardless of its size or domain. As such, aggregating the demands could lead to better value-for-money due to: (1) lower bulk prices; (2) larger vendor tendering; (3) lower shipping and handling fees; and (4) reduced legal and administration overheads. This paper describes our experience in developing an AI solution for demand aggregation and deploying it in A*STAR, a large governmental research organization in Singapore with procurement expenditure to the scale of hundreds of millions of dollars annually. We formulate the demand aggregation problem using a bipartite graph model depicting the relationship between procured items and target vendors, and show that identifying maximal edge bicliques within that graph would reveal potential demand aggregation patterns. We propose an unsupervised learning methodology for efficiently mining such bicliques using a novel Monte Carlo subspace clustering approach. Based on this, a proof-of-concept prototype was developed and tested with the end users during 2017, and later trialed and iteratively refined, before being rolled out in 2019. The final performance achieved on past cases benchmark was: 100% precision (all aggregation opportunities identified by the engine were correct) and 71% recall (the engine correctly identified 71% of the past aggregation exercises that were transformed into bulk tenders). The performance for new opportunities pointed out by the engine was 81% (i.e., 81% of the newly identified cases were deemed useful cases for potential bulk tender contracts in the future). Overall, the cost savings from the true positive contracts spotted so far are estimated to be S$7 million annually.",38951152,38951198,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/IAAI-190.ShahamE.pdf,4-Feb,,,,G,,IAAI-D1-B,B,4,commerce,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=IAAI-190
