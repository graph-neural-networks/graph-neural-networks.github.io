  What Can and Should Humans Contribute to Superhuman AIs?
<br>
  I will discuss what humans can and should contribute to superhuman AIs—not general ones intended to
  be like humans, but ones for specific applications that make the world a better place. I will discuss how
  the application should drive research. I will present extensive experiences from having fielded
  superhuman AIs for combinatorial markets, organ exchanges, and imperfect-information game settings.
  I will discuss inventing and scoping novel AI applications. I will discuss how humans should supply the
  value framework while leaving policy optimization and combinatorics for AI. I will cover a framework
  that separates those ends and means, and conducts future-aware optimization in very-large-scale
  dynamic problems in a scalable way. I will wonder about the future of science when theorems (not just
  proofs) and empirical theories need to be so long that they are beyond human comprehension. I will
  discuss human overconfidence in humans over AI. I will discuss what explainability could be and why in
  many AI applications it should not be required. Finally, I will suggest flipping ethics around from an ex
  post discussion activity to a system-design discipline that I coin pre-design ethics.

  bio: "[Tuomas Sandholm](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/) is Angel Jordan University Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University and a serial entrepreneur. His research focuses on the convergence of artificial intelligence, economics, and operations research. He is Co-Director of CMU AI. He is Founder and Director of the Electronic Marketplaces Laboratory.

                                                                             In parallel with his academic career, he was Founder, Chairman, first CEO, and CTO/Chief Scientist of CombineNet, Inc. from 1997 until its acquisition in 2010. During this period the company commercialized over 800 of the world’s largest-scale generalized combinatorial multi-attribute auctions, with over $60 billion in total spend and over $6 billion in generated savings. He is Founder and CEO of Optimized Markets, Inc., which is bringing a new optimization-powered paradigm to advertising campaign sales, scheduling, and pricing in linear and nonlinear TV, display, streaming, and cross-media advertising.

                                                                             Since 2010, his algorithms have been running the national kidney exchange for UNOS, where they make the kidney exchange transplant plan for 80% of U.S. transplant centers together each week. He also co-invented never-ending altruist-donor-initiated chains, which have become the main modality of kidney exchange worldwide and have led to around 10,000 life-saving transplants. He invented liver lobe and multi-organ exchanges, and the first liver-kidney swap took place in 2019.
                                                                             He has developed the leading algorithms and pipelines for several general game classes. The team he leads is the multi-time world champion in AI-vs-AI heads-up no-limit Texas hold’em, the main benchmark and decades-open challenge problem for application-independent algorithms for imperfect-information games. Their AI Libratus became the first and only AI to beat top humans at that game. Then their AI Pluribus became the first and only AI to beat top humans at the multi-player game. That is the first superhuman milestone in any game beyond two-player zero-sum games. He is Founder and CEO of Strategic Machine, Inc., which provides solutions for strategic reasoning in business and gaming applications. He is Founder and CEO of Strategy Robot, Inc., which focuses on defense, intelligence, and other government applications.

  abstract: "In recent years, large language models pretrained on vast quantities of raw text have revolutionized NLP. Existing methods, based on variations of causal or masked languages models, now provide the de facto methods for every NLP task. In this talk, I will discuss recent work on language model pretraining, from ELMo, GPT, and BERT to more recent models.  I will aim for broad coverage of the overall trends but provide more details on the models we have been developing recently at Facebook AI and the University of Washington. These include in particular pre-training methods for sequence-to-sequence models, such as BART, mBART, and MARGE, which provide some of the most generally applicable approaches to date.

  abstract: "Since everything went crazy in AI, around 2012, I, like many other members of our community,\
   have frequently found myself put in the position of having to talk about our field to a non-specialist audience. \
   I’ve been interviewed on TV and radio, and spoken to endless university committees, government committees, and industrial \
   conferences. More recently, following the publication of my two popular science books (the Ladybird Expert Guide to \
   AI [2018], and The Road to Conscious Machines [2020]), I’ve even begun speaking at a literary festivals (believe me, \
   I never expected to be doing this as a PhD student studying multiagent systems back in 1989). In this talk, I will \
   relate these experiences, the mistakes I made, and what I learned from them – how our field is perceived, what people\
    fear, hope, and expect from it, and how best to communicate excitement about the very real progress we’ve made recently\
     with a realistic understanding of where we are and where we are going.

Data-driven algorithms and technology designers are the new policymakers. No one elected them, and most people do not know their names, but the decisions they make dictate the code by which we conduct our daily lives and govern our country. Challenges to the privacy of our personal data were the first wave of this change; as technology progresses, every demographic value and every law has come up for grabs and will likely be redefined by what technology does or does not enable. How will it all fit together or fall apart?

  abstract: "Deep learning's successes have led to dramatic progress in some classic AI tasks. Can it take us all the way to full AI? We argue that the current black box view of deep learning will prove a big hurdle.  Via a tour d'horizon of recent theoretical analyses of  deep learning in some concrete settings,  we illustrate how the black box view can miss out on special phenomena going on during training that are not captured by the training objective. We argue that understanding such phenomena via mathematical understanding will be crucial for enabling the full range of AI applications."

  abstract: "The global pandemic that engulfed the world in 2020 gave rise to an immediate imperative to transition many of our activities to a digital format. One of the more significant of these activities was the sudden transition to the use of online platforms for providing education. This online transition caught the vast majority of academic institutions unprepared, and most defaulted to an approach of “let’s do what we’ve always done, just over video”. This paradigm led to a considerable decline in student satisfaction and achievement. In this talk, I will argue that this challenge is also an unprecedented opportunity that can help us transform the way in which we teach. By building innovative digital learning platforms that implement best practices from teaching and learning, we can enable active learning and collaboration, measure and enhance student engagement, and increase student success. In fact, some of these interventions are considerably easier to deploy on a digital platform than they are in traditional classrooms. Moreover, this new way of teaching can be more inclusive than traditional approaches, and disproportionately benefit students from less advantaged backgrounds. Finally, digital learning opens the door to the collection of massive amounts of data about teaching and learning, which will enable us to develop and deploy human-driven or AI-driven interventions that can further enhance student engagement and  success.
