AISI-843,AI for Social Impact,Abusive Language Detection in Heterogeneous Contexts: Dataset Collection and the Role of Supervised Attention,Hongyu Gong|Alberto Valido|Katherine M Ingram|Giulia Fanti|Suma Bhat|Dorothy L Espelage,"Abusive language is a massive problem in online social platforms. Existing abusive language detection techniques are particularly ill-suited to comments containing heterogeneous abusive language patterns, i.e., both abusive and non-abusive parts. This is due in part to the lack of datasets that explicitly annotate heterogeneity in abusive language. We tackle this challenge by providing an annotated dataset of abusive language in over 11,000 comments from YouTube. We account for heterogeneity in this dataset by separately annotating both the comment as a whole and the individual sentences that comprise each comment. We then propose an algorithm that uses a supervised attention mechanism to detect and categorize abusive content using multi-task learning. We empirically demonstrate the challenges of using traditional techniques on heterogeneous content and the comparative gains in performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art methods.",38951027,38951067,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-843.GongH.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,K,8,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=843
AISI-1058,AI for Social Impact,Learning Augmented Methods for Matching: Improving Invasive Species Management and Urban Mobility,Johan Björck|Qinru Shi|Carrie Brown-Lima|Jennifer Dean|Angela Fuller|Carla P Gomes,"With the success of machine learning, integrating learned models into real-world systems has become a critical challenge. Naively applying predictions to combinatorial optimization problems can incur high costs, which has motivated researchers to consider learning augmented algorithms that can make use of faulty or incomplete predictions. Inspired by two matching problems in computational sustainability where data is abundant, we consider the learning augmented min weight matching problem where some nodes are revealed online while others are known a priori, e.g., by being predicted by machine learning. We develop an algorithm that is able to make use of this extra information and provably improves upon pessimistic online algorithms. We evaluate our algorithm on two settings from computational sustainability -- the coordination of unreliable citizen scientists for invasive species management, and the matching between taxis and riders under uncertain trip duration predictions. In both cases, we perform extensive experiments on real-world datasets and find that our method outperforms baselines, showing how learning augmented algorithms can reliably improve solutions for problems in computational sustainability.",38951028,38951068,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-1058.BjorckJ.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,J,6,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=1058

Prior works have shown that using Computer Vision (CV) techniques to identify smoke as visual evidence can influence the attitude of regulators and empower citizens to pursue environmental justice. However, existing datasets are not of sufficient quality nor quantity to train the robust CV models needed to support air quality advocacy. We introduce RISE, the first large-scale video dataset for Recognizing Industrial Smoke Emissions. We adopted a citizen science approach to collaborate with local community members to annotate whether a video clip has smoke emissions. Our dataset contains 12,567 clips from 19 distinct views from cameras that monitored three industrial facilities. These daytime clips span 30 days over two years, including all four seasons. We ran experiments using deep neural networks to establish a strong performance baseline and reveal smoke recognition challenges.

AISI-1438,AI for Social Impact,Fair and Interpretable Algorithmic Hiring Using Evolutionary Many Objective Optimization,Michael Geden|Joshua Andrews,"Hiring is a high-stakes decision-making process that balances the joint objectives of being fair and accurately selecting the top candidates. The industry standard method employs subject-matter experts to manually generate hiring algorithms; however, this method is resource intensive and finds sub-optimal solutions. Despite the recognized need for algorithmic hiring solutions to address these limitations, no reported method currently supports optimizing predictive objectives while complying to legal fairness standards. We present the novel application of Evolutionary Many-Objective Optimization (EMOO) methods to create the first fair, interpretable, and legally compliant algorithmic hiring approach. Using a proposed novel application of Dirichlet-based genetic operators for improved search, we compare state-of-the-art EMOO models (NSGA-III, SPEA2-SDE, bi-goal evolution) to expert solutions, verifying our results across three real world datasets across diverse organizational positions. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed EMOO models outperform human experts, consistently generate fairer hiring algorithms, and can provide additional lift when removing constraints required for human analysis.

A challenge to using this machinery for computational sustainability is the necessity of massive labeled data sets, which can be cost-prohibitive for many non-profit organizations. The primary motivation for this work is one such problem; the efficient management of invasive species -- invading flora and fauna that are estimated to cause damages in the billions of dollars annually. As an ongoing collaboration with a NY state foundation, we consider the use of unsupervised deep learning techniques for dimensionality reduction of remote sensing images, which can reduce sample complexity for downstream tasks and decreases the need for large labeled data sets. We consider spatially augmenting contrastive learning by training neural networks to correctly classify two nearby patches of a landscape as such. We demonstrate that this approach improves upon previous methods and naive classification for a large scale data set of remote sensing images derived from invasive species observations obtained over 30 years. Additionally, we simulate deployment in the field via active learning and evaluate this method on another important challenge in computational sustainability -- landcover classification -- and again find that it outperforms previous baselines.",38951031,38951071,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-2361.Bjorck.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,D,B,AB-D2-R2,A,5,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=2361

Prominent lines of prior research across multiple disciplines have observed and analyzed growing polarization in social media. In this paper, we present a new methodology that offers a fresh perspective on interpreting polarization through the lens of machine translation. With a novel proposition that two sub-communities are speaking in two different \emph{languages}, we demonstrate that modern machine translation methods can provide a simple yet powerful and interpretable framework to understand the differences between two (or more) large-scale social media discussion data sets at the granularity of words. Via a substantial corpus of 86.6 million comments by 6.5 million users on over 200,000 news videos hosted by YouTube channels of four prominent US news networks, we demonstrate that simple word-level and phrase-level translation pairs can reveal deep insights into the current political divide -- what is \emph{black lives matter} to one can be \emph{all lives matter} to the other.",38951032,38951072,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-2462.KhudaBukhshA.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,K,3,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=2462
AISI-2820,AI for Social Impact,Early Safety Warnings for Long-Distance Pipelines: A Distributed Optical Fiber Sensor Machine Learning Approach,Yiyuan Yang|Yi Li|Taojia Zhang|Yan Zhou|Haifeng Zhang,"Automated pipeline safety early warning (PSEW) systems are designed to automatically identify and locate third-party damage events on oil and gas pipelines. They are intended to replace traditional, inefficient manual inspection methods. However, current PSEW methods cannot achieve universality for various complex environments because they are sensitive to the spatiotemporal stability of the signal obtained by its distributed sensors at various locations and times. Our research aimed to improve the accuracy of long-distance oil–gas PSEW systems through machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel real-time action recognition method for long-distance PSEW systems based on a coherent Rayleigh scattering distributed optical fiber sensor. More specifically, we put forward two complementary feature calculation methods to describe signals and build a new action recognition deep learning network based on those features. Encouraging empirical results on the data collected at a real location confirm that the features can effectively describe signals in an environment with strong noise and weak signals, and the entire approach can identify and locate third-party damage events quickly under various hardware conditions with accuracies of 99.26% (500 Hz) and 97.20% (100 Hz). More generically, our method can be applied to other fields as well.",38951033,38951073,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-2820.YangY.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,A,A,AC-D2-R1,H,3,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=2820
AISI-3032,AI for Social Impact,Forecasting Reservoir Inflow via Recurrent Neural ODEs,Fan Zhou|Liang Li,"Forecasting reservoir inflow is critical for making many policies, ranging from flood control and agriculture irrigation to water ecology management, hydropower generation, and landslide prevention. Prior studies mainly exploit autoregressive models -- e.g., recurrent neural networks (RNN) and its many variants -- to model the flow time series's temporal pattern. However, existing approaches rely on regular and accurate inflow observations, which either fail to predict multi-scale inflow (e.g., an hour, a day, or a month ahead prediction) or ignore the uncertainty of observations due to confounding factors such as snowmelt and precipitation. To address the limitations, we propose a novel inflow forecasting model by incorporating the uncertainty of the observations into the RNN model and the continuous-time dynamics of the latent states with neural ordinary differential equations (ODE). Our method, called FlowODE, explicitly encodes the stochasticity of hidden conditions in addition to the temporal dependencies among inflow observations. Moreover, FlowODE explores a continuum of layers instead of discrete RNNs to model the hidden states' dynamics, allowing us to infer the inflow at any time horizon flexibly. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world datasets collected from two large-scale hydropower dams. The results show that our method consistently outperforms previous inflow forecasting models while providing adaptable predictions and a flexible balance between prediction accuracy and computational cost.",38951034,38951074,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-3032.ZhouFan.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,A,A,AC-D2-R1,J,3,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=3032
AISI-3105,AI for Social Impact,Retrieve and Revise: Improving Peptide Identification with Similar Mass Spectra,Zhengcong Fei,"Tandem mass spectrometry is an indispensable technology for identification of proteins from complex mixtures. Accurate and sensitive analysis of large amounts of mass spectra data is a principal challenge in proteomics. Conventional deep learning-based peptide identification models usually adopt an encoder-decoder framework and generate target sequence from left to right without fully exploiting the global information. A few recent approaches seek to employ two-pass decoding, yet have limitations when facing the spectra filled with noise. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for improved peptide identification, which first retrieves a similar mass spectrum from the database as a reference and then revise the matched sequence according to the difference information between the referenced spectrum and current context. The inspiration of design comes that the retrieved peptide-spectrum pair provides a good start point and indirect access to both past and future information, such that each revised amino acid can be produced with better noise perception and global understanding. Moreover, a disturb-based optimization process is introduced to sharpen the attention for difference vector with reinforcement learning before fed to decoder. Experimental results on several public datasets demonstrate that prominent performance boost is obtained with the proposed method. Remarkably, we achieve new state-of-the-art identification results on these datasets.

Unlike general GNNs tackling tasks in the plain graphs, our method is capable of generalizing 3D spatial knowledge from InSAR point clouds. Specifically, we structure of the land surface, while preserving the spatial correlations among adjacent points. The point cloud can then be efficiently converted to a near-neighbor graph where general GNN methods can be applied to predict the displacement of the slope surface. We conducted experiments on real-world datasets and the  results demonstrate that SA-GNN outperforms existing 3D CNN and point GNN methods.",38951036,38951076,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-3133.ZhouF.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,A,A,AC-D2-R1,J,1,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=3133

However, these data pose considerable challenges for artificial intelligence: while growing rapidly in volume, they remain highly incomplete for many taxonomic groups, often show conflicting signals from different sources, and are multi-modal and therefore constantly changing in structure. In this paper, we motivate, describe, and present a novel workflow combining machine learning and automated reasoning, to discover patterns of taxonomic identity and change - i.e. “taxonomic intelligence” - leading to scalable and broadly impactful AI solutions within the bio-data realm.",38951037,38951077,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-3631.SenA.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,J,4,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=3631
AISI-3750,AI for Social Impact,Harnessing Social Media to Identify Homeless Youth At-Risk of Substance Use,Zi-Yi Dou|Anamika Barman-Adhikari|Fei Fang|Amulya Yadav,"Homeless youths are a highly vulnerable population and report highly elevated rates of substance use. Prior work on mitigating substance use among homeless youth has primarily relied on survey data to get information about substance use among homeless youth, which can then be used to inform the design of targeted intervention programs. However, such survey data is often onerous to collect, is limited by its reliance on self-reports and retrospective recall, and quickly becomes dated. The advent of social media has provided us with an important data source for understanding the health behaviors of homeless youth. In this paper, we target this specific population and demonstrate how to detect substance use based on texts from social media. We collect $\sim$135K Facebook posts and comments together with survey responses from a group of homeless youth and use this data to build novel substance use detection systems with machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Experimental results show that our proposed methods achieve ROC-AUC scores of up to 0.77 on identifying certain kinds of substance use among homeless youth using Facebook conversations only and up to 0.8 when combined with answers to 4 survey questions that are not about their demographic characteristics or substance use.

AISI-3785,AI for Social Impact,Intelligent Recommendations for Citizen Science,Kobi Gal|Guy Shani|Avi Segal|Darlene Cavalier|Daniel Ben Zaken,"Citizen science  refers to scientific research that is carried out by volunteers, often in collaboration with professional scientists. The spread of the internet has   allowed volunteers to contribute to Citizen Science projects in  dramatically new ways. For example, SciStarter, our partners in the project, is an online portal that offers more than  3,000 affiliate projects and recruits volunteers through media and other organizations, bringing citizen science to people.  Given the sheer size of available projects, finding the right project, which best suits the user preferences and capabilities, has become a major challenge and is essential for keeping volunteers motivated and active contributors. This paper  addresses this challenge by developing a system for personalizing  project recommendations in the SciStarter ecosystem. We adapted several recommendation algorithms to the citizen science domain from the literature based on collaborative filtering and matrix factorization.  The algorithms were trained on historical data of users' interactions in SciStarter as well as their contributions to different projects. The trained algorithms were deployed in   SciStarter in a study    involving hundreds of users who were  provided with personalized recommendations for   projects they had not contributed to before. Volunteers were randomly divided into different cohorts, which varied the recommendation algorithm that was used to generate suggested projects. The results show that using the new recommendation system  led people to contribute to  new projects that they had never tried before and  led to increased participation in SciStarter projects when compared to   cohort groups that were recommended the most popular projects, or did not receive recommendations.   In particular, the cohort of volunteers receiving recommendations created by an SVD algorithm (matrix factorization) exhibited the highest levels of contributions to new projects, when compared to the other cohorts.  A follow-up survey conducted with the SciStarter community confirms that users were  satisfied with the recommendation tool and claimed that the recommendations  matched their personal interests and goals. Based on the positive results, our recommendation system is now fully integrated in the   SciStarter portal, positively affecting hundreds of users each week.  The research has transformed how SciStarter helps projects recruit and support participants and better respond to their needs.",38951039,38951079,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-3785.DayanN.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,D,B,AB-D2-R2,B,5,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=3785
AISI-3849,AI for Social Impact,Graph Learning for Inverse Landscape Genetics,Prathamesh Dharangutte|Christopher Musco,"The problem of inferring unknown graph edges from numerical data at a graph's nodes appears in many forms across machine learning. We study a version of this problem that arises in the field of landscape genetics, where genetic similarity between organisms living in a heterogeneous landscape is explained by a weighted graph that encodes the ease of dispersal through that landscape.Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for inverse landscape genetics, which is the task of inferring this graph from measurements of genetic similarity at different locations (graph nodes). Inverse landscape genetics is important in discovering impediments to species dispersal that threaten biodiversity and long-term species survival. In particular, it is widely used to study the effects of climate change and human development. Drawing on influential work that models organism dispersal using graph effective resistances (McRae 2006), we reduce the inverse landscape genetics problem to that of inferring graph edges from noisy measurements of these resistances, which can be obtained from genetic similarity data. Building on the NeurIPS 2018 work of Hoskins et al. (2018) on learning edges in social networks, we develop an efficient first-order optimization method for solving this problem. Despite its non-convex nature, experiments on synthetic and real genetic data establish that our method provides fast and reliable convergence, significantly outperforming existing heuristics used in the field.By providing researchers with a powerful, general purpose algorithmic tool, we hope our work will have a positive impact on accelerating work on landscape genetics.",38951040,38951080,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-3849.DharangutteP.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,J,3,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=3849
AISI-4304,AI for Social Impact,Predicting Forest Fire Using Remote Sensing Data and Machine Learning,Suwei Yang|Massimo Lupascu|Kuldeep S Meel,"Over the last few decades, deforestation and climate change have caused increasing number of forest fires. In SoutheastAsia, Indonesia has been the most affected country by tropical peatland forest fires. These fires have a significant impact on the climate resulting in extensive health, social and economic issues. Existing forest fire prediction systems, such as the Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System, are based on handcrafted features and require installation and maintenance of expensive instruments on the ground, which can be a challenge for developing countries such as Indonesia. We propose a novel, cost-effective, machine-learning based approach that uses remote sensing data to predict forest fires in Indonesia.Our prediction model achieves more than 0.81 area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve, performing significantly better than the baseline approach which never exceeds  0.70  area  under  ROC  curve  on  the  same  tasks.  Our model’s performance remained above 0.81 area under ROC curve  even  when  evaluated  with  reduced  data.

Defenders must choose how much time to spend in each region of the protected area, balancing exploration of infrequently visited regions and exploitation of known hotspots. We formulate the problem as a stochastic multi-armed bandit, where each action represents a patrol strategy, enabling us to guarantee the rate of convergence of the patrolling policy. However, a naive bandit approach would compromise short-term performance for long-term optimality, resulting in animals poached and forests destroyed. To speed up performance, we leverage smoothness in the reward function and decomposability of actions. We show a synergy between Lipschitz-continuity and decomposition as each aids the convergence of the other. In doing so, we bridge the gap between combinatorial and Lipschitz bandits, presenting a no-regret approach that tightens existing guarantees while optimizing for short-term performance. We demonstrate that our algorithm, LIZARD, improves performance on real-world poaching data from Cambodia.",38951042,38951082,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-4906.XuL.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,J,8,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=4906
AISI-5196,AI for Social Impact,Goten: GPU-Outsourcing Trusted Execution of Neural Network Training and Prediction,Lucien K.L. Ng|Sherman S. M. Chow|Pui Yung Anna Woo|Yongjun Zhao,"Deep learning unlocks applications with societal impacts, e.g., detecting child exploitation imagery and genomic analysis of rare diseases. Deployment, however, needs compliance with stringent privacy regulations. Training algorithms that preserve the privacy of training data are in pressing need.Purely-cryptographic approaches, relying on two or more non-colluding servers for efficiency (CCS'19, NDSS'20, PETS'21), are still costly, having latency increases with the size of the finite field they operate over. Seemingly ``trivial'' operations in plaintext quickly become prohibitively inefficient when a series of them are ``crypto-processed,'' e.g., (dynamic) quantization for ensuring the intermediate values would not overflow in the finite field.Recently, Slalom (Tramer--Boneh, ICLR'19) is proposed as the first solution that leverages both GPU (for efficient batch computation) and a trusted execution environment (TEE) (for minimizing the use of cryptography). Roughly, it works by a lot of pre-computation over known and fixed weights, and hence it only supports private inference. Five related problems for private training are explicitly left unaddressed.Goten, our privacy-preserving training and prediction framework, tackles all five problems simultaneously via our careful design over the ``mismatched'' cryptographic and GPU data types (due to the tension between precision and efficiency) and our round-optimal GPU-outsourcing protocol. It 1) stochastically trains a low-bitwidth model (ICML'19) that is accurate enough,2) supports dynamic quantization (a challenge left by Slalom), 3) minimizes the memory-swapping overhead (cf., EuroSys'17, ATC'19)of the memory-limited TEE and its communication with the GPU,4) crypto-protects the (dynamic) model weight from untrusted GPU,and 5) outperforms a pure-TEE system, even without pre-computation (needed by Slalom).Notably, we tailor-made secure primitives for common frameworks such as Caffe (MM'14). Compared to a pure-TEE system, Goten can speed up the whole VGG11 by 6.84x. Compared to Falcon's (PETS'21), the state-of-the-art, Goten outperforms by 132.64x for VGG11. Goten also demonstrates its efficacy in training models for breast cancer diagnosis (IDC), a privacy-sensitive task.",38951043,38951083,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-5196.NgL.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,D,B,AB-D2-R2,B,2,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=5196
AISI-5504,AI for Social Impact,Detection and Prediction of Nutrient Deficiency Stress Using Longitudinal Aerial Imagery,Saba Dadsetan|Gisele Rose|Naira Hovakimyan|Jennifer Hobbs,"Early, precise detection of nutrient deficiency stress (NDS) has key economic as well as environmental impact; precision application of chemicals in place of blanket application reduces operational costs for the growers while reducing the amount of chemicals which may enter the environment unnecessarily.  Furthermore, earlier treatment reduces the amount of loss and therefore boosts crop production during a given season.  With this in mind, we collect sequences of high-resolution aerial imagery and construct semantic segmentation models to detect and predict NDS across the field.  Our work sits at the intersection of agriculture, remote sensing, and modern computer vision and deep learning.  First, we establish a baseline for full-field detection of NDS and quantify the impact of pretraining, backbone architecture, input representation, and sampling strategy.  We then quantify the amount of information available at different points in the season by building a single-timestamp model based on a UNet.  Next, we construct our proposed spatiotemporal architecture, which combines a UNet with a convolutional LSTM layer, to accurately detect regions of the field showing NDS; this approach has an impressive IOU score of 0.53.  Finally, we show that this architecture can be trained to predict regions of the field which are expected to show NDS in a later flight -potentially more than three weeks in the future- maintaining an IOU score of 0.47-0.51 depending on how far in advance the prediction is made.  We will also release a dataset which we believe will benefit the computer vision, remote sensing, as well as agriculture fields.

This in turn leads to a challenging and long-standing problem in the field of computer science - how to perform accurate multi-label classification with hundreds of labels? The key challenge of this problem is its exponential-sized output space with regards to the number of labels to be predicted. Therefore, it is essential to facilitate the learning process by exploiting correlations (or dependency) among labels. Previous methods mostly focus on modelling the correlation on label pairs; however, complex relations between real-world objects often go beyond second order. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multi-label classification, High-order Tie-in Variational Autoencoder (HOT-VAE), which performs adaptive high-order label correlation learning. We experimentally verify that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches on a bird distribution dataset on both conventional F1 scores and a variety of ecological metrics. To show our method is general, we also perform empirical analysis on seven other public real-world datasets in several application domains, and Hot-VAE exhibits superior performance to previous methods.",38951045,38951085,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-5972.ZhaoW.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,J,7,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=5972

A key goal for health equity is to improve adoption of protective behaviors in this population. One promising strategy for intervention is to recruit peer leaders from the population of YEH to promote behaviors such as condom usage and regular HIV testing to their social contacts. This raises a computational question: which youth should be selected as peer leaders to maximize the overall impact of the intervention? We developed an artificial intelligence system to optimize such social network interventions in a community health setting. We conducted a clinical trial enrolling 713 YEH at drop-in centers in a large US city. The clinical trial compared interventions planned with the algorithm to those where the highest-degree nodes in the youths' social network were recruited as peer leaders (the standard method in public health) and to an observation-only control group. Results from the clinical trial show that youth in the AI group experience statistically significant reductions in key risk behaviors for HIV transmission, while those in the other groups do not. This provides, to our knowledge, the first empirical validation of the usage of AI methods to optimize social network interventions for health. We conclude by discussing lessons learned over the course of the project which may inform future attempts to use AI in community-level interventions.",38951046,38951086,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-6126.WilderB.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,J,2,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=6126

Second, the redemptions of coupons are partially observed, as we can only observe that the customer redeems the coupon or not at a specific incentive value,  but cannot observe that at other incentive value, i.e., \emph{data censorship} issue.In this paper, we propose a novel joint incentive optimization framework to address the above two issues. We propose to use a graph neural network to represent customers and merchants jointly by modeling the underlying bipartite influences.We then formulate the response model under the hazard regression setting and model the hazard rate with a piecewise nonlinear function to capture the changes of responses to different incentive values.Finally, we propose a linear programming method to allocate approximated optimal incentive values to customers and merchants in real-time.

Currently, state-of-the-art approaches use privacy-preserving generative adversarial networks (PP-GANs) for this purpose, for instance, to enable reliable facial expression recognition without leaking users' identity. However, PP-GANs do not offer formal proofs of privacy and instead rely on experimentally measuring information leakage using classification accuracy on the sensitive attributes of deep learning (DL)-based discriminators. In this work, we question the rigor of such checks by subverting existing privacy-preserving GANs for facial expression recognition. We show that it is possible to hide the sensitive identification data in the sanitized output images of such PP-GANs for later extraction, which can even allow for reconstruction of the entire input images, while satisfying privacy checks. We demonstrate our approach via a PP-GAN-based architecture and provide qualitative and quantitative evaluations using two public datasets. Our experimental results raise fundamental questions about the need for more rigorous privacy checks of PP-GANs, and we provide insights into the social impact of these.",38951048,38951088,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-6289.LiuK.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,K,2,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=6289

However, some authors may intentionally avoid using sensitive words in their pornographic texts to take advantage of the lack of human audits. Without prior knowledge guidance, real semantics of such pornographic text is difficult to understand by existing methods due to its high context-sensitivity and heavy usage of figurative language, which brings huge challenges to the porn detection systems used in social media platforms. In this paper, we approach to the problem as a document-level porn identification task by locating and integrating sentence-level evidence and propose a novel Evidence-Aware Neural Porn Classification (eNPC) model. Specifically, we first propose a basic model which locates porn indicative sentences in the document with a multiple instance learning model, and then aggregate the sentence-level evidence to induce document label with self-attention mechanism. Moreover, we consider label dependencies within local context. Finally, we further enhance the sentence representation with prior knowledge produced by an automatic porn lexicon construction strategy.

AISI-6699,AI for Social Impact,A Universal 2-State n-Action Adaptive Management Solver,Luz V Pascal|Marianne Akian|Sam Nicol|Iadine Chades,"In poor data and urgent decision-making applications, managers need to make decisions without complete knowledge of the system dynamics. In biodiversity conservation, adaptive management (AM) is the principal tool for decision-making under uncertainty. AM can be solved using simplified Mixed Observable Markov Decision Processes called hidden model MDPs (hmMDPs) when the unknown dynamics are assumed stationary. hmMDPs provide optimal policies to AM problems by augmenting the MDP state space with an unobservable state variable representing a finite set of predefined models. A drawback in formalising an AM problem is that experts are often solicited to provide this predefined set of models by specifying the transition matrices. Expert elicitation is a challenging and time-consuming process that is prone to biases, and a key assumption of hmMDPs is that the true transition matrix will be included in the candidate model set. We propose an original approach to build a hmMDP with a universal set of predefined models that is capable of solving any $2$-state $n$-action AM problem. Our approach uses properties of the transition matrices to build the model set and is independent of expert input, removing the potential for expert error in the optimal solution. We provide analytical formulations to derive the minimum set of models to include into an hmMDP to solve any AM problems with 2 states and $n$ actions. We assess our universal AM algorithm on two species conservation case studies from Australia and randomly generated problems.

AISI-6902,AI for Social Impact,Fairness in Influence Maximization through Randomization,Ruben Becker|Gianlorenzo D'Angelo|Sajjad Ghobadi|Hugo Gilbert,"The influence maximization paradigm has been used by researchers in various fields in order to study how information spreads in social networks. While previously the attention was mostly on efficiency, more recently fairness issues have been taken into account in this scope. In the present paper, we propose to use randomization as a mean for achieving fairness. While this general idea is not new, it has not been applied in the area of information spread in networks.Similar to previous works like Fish et al. (WWW '19) and Tsang et al. (IJCAI '19), we study the maximin criterion for (group) fairness. By allowing randomized solutions, we introduce two different variants of this problem. While the original deterministic maximin problem has been shown to be inapproximable, interestingly, we show that both probabilistic variants permit approximation algorithms with a constant multiplicative factor of 1-1/e plus an additive arbitrarily small error that is due to the simulation of the information spread. For an experimental study, we provide implementations of our methods and compare the achieved fairness values to existing methods. Non-surprisingly,  the ex-ante values, i.e., minimum expected value of an individual (or group) to obtain the information, of the computed probabilistic strategies are significantly larger than the (ex-post) fairness values of previous methods. This confirms that studying fairness via randomization is a worthwhile direction. More surprisingly, we observe that even the ex-post fairness values, i.e., fairness values of sets sampled according to the probabilistic strategies, computed by our routines dominate over the fairness achieved by previous methods on most of the instances tested.",38951051,38951091,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-6902.BeckerR.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,D,B,AB-D2-R2,B,4,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=6902

AM problems are planning problems that can be modelled using Mixed Observability MDPs (MOMDPs). MOMDPs tackle decision problems where state variables are completely or partially observable. Unfortunately, MOMDP solutions (policy graphs) are too complex to be interpreted by human decision-makers. Here, we provide algorithms to solve $K$-$N$-MOMDPs, where $K$ represents the maximum number of fully observable states and $N$ represents the maximum number of $\alpha$-vectors. From existing MOMDP models and solutions we calculate compact and more interpretable policy graphs. We apply these algorithms to two computational sustainability applications: optimal release of bio-control agents to prevent dengue epidemics and conservation of the  threatened bird species \textit{Gouldian finch}. The methods dramatically reduce the number of states and $\alpha$-vectors in MOMDP problems without significantly reducing their quality.

For example, using 24 hours data of a cyclone anytime during its course, the model provides state-of-the-art results by predicting landfall intensity, time, latitude, and longitude with a mean absolute error of 4.24 knots, 4.5 hours, 0.24 degree, and 0.37 degree respectively, which resulted in a distance error of 51.7 kilometers from the landfall location.

Until now, fire fighters rely only on their experience to avoid life-threatening fire events, such as flashover. In this paper, we describe the development of a flashover prediction model which can be used to warn fire fighters before flashover occurs. Specifically, we consider the use of a fire simulation program to generate a set of synthetic data and an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory to learn the complex relationships between temperature signals and flashover conditions. We first validate the fire simulation program with temperature measurements obtained from full-scale fire experiments. Then, we generate a set of synthetic temperature data which account for the realis-tic fire and vent opening conditions in a multi-compartment structure. Results show that our proposed method achieves promising performance for prediction of flashover even when temperature data is completely lost in the room of fire origin.

Yet, those most in need of this technology are often the most underserved by it. In many countries, illiterate people tend to speak only low-resource languages, for which the datasets necessary for speech technology development are scarce.  In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of unsupervised speech representation learning on noisy radio broadcasting archives, which are abundant even in low-resource languages. We make three core contributions. First, we release two datasets to the research community. The first, West African Radio Corpus, contains 142 hours of audio in more than 10 languages with a labeled validation subset. The second, West African Virtual Assistant Speech Recognition Corpus, consists of 10K labeled audio clips in four languages. Next, we share West African wav2vec, a speech encoder trained on the noisy radio corpus, and compare it with the baseline Facebook speech encoder trained on six times more data of higher quality. We show that West African wav2vec performs similarly to the baseline on a multilingual speech recognition task, and significantly outperforms the baseline on a West African language identification task. Finally, we share the first-ever speech recognition models for Maninka, Pular and Susu, languages spoken by a combined 10 million people spanning over seven countries where illiteracy rates are up to 68 percent.

No prior work has leveraged pre-specified future reference items to improve this type of challenging consecutive prediction task at inference time. PLAN-BERT is the first to accommodate this general planning scenario. It does so by contributing novel modifications that take inspiration from the masked training and contextual embedding of self-attention models. To test the model, we use the domain of student academic degree planning, in which students’ past course histories and future pre-specified courses of interest are used to fill in the remainder of their curriculum. Our offline analyses consist of 15 million historic course enrollments at 20 institutions and an online evaluation conducted at one of the institutions.

The historical behaviors of users provide rich information for digging into the users' fraud risk. While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, a long-standing challenge is how to effectively exploit internal user information and provide explainable prediction results. In fact, the value variations of same field from different events and the interactions of different fields inside one event have proven to be strong indicators for fraudulent behaviors. In this paper, we propose the Dual Importance-aware Factorization Machines (DIFM), which exploits the internal field information among users’ behavior sequence from dual perspectives, i.e., field value variations and field interactions simultaneously for fraud detection. The proposed model is deployed in the risk management system of one of the world’s largest e-commerce platforms, which utilize it to provide real-time transaction fraud detection.

However, the pattern of these hits cannot be easily summarized. The existing objective postprocessing methods tend to extend the rain area or false alarm the precipitation intensity categories. In this work, we introduce a multi-layer structure to simultaneously reduce the bias in forecast ensembles output by meteorology models and merge them to a quality deterministic (single-valued) forecast using cross-grid information, which differs quite dramatically from the previous statistical postprocessing method. The multi-layer network is designed to model the spatial distribution of future precipitation of different intensity categories(IC-MLNet). We provide a comparison of IC-MLNet to simple average as well as another two state-of-the-art ensemble quantitative precipitation forecasts (QPFs) postprocessing approaches over both single-model and multi-model ensemble forecasts datasets from TIGGE.

Unfortunately, transit services that provide wide coverage tend to suffer from relatively low utilization, which results in high fuel usage per passenger per mile, leading to high operating costs and environmental impact. Electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce energy costs and environmental impact, but most public transit agencies have to employ them in combination with conventional, internal-combustion engine vehicles due to the high upfront costs of EVs. To make the best use of such a mixed fleet of vehicles, transit agencies need to optimize route assignments and charging schedules, which presents a challenging problem for large transit networks. We introduce a novel problem formulation to minimize fuel and electricity use by assigning vehicles to transit trips and scheduling them for charging, while serving an existing fixed-route transit schedule. We present an integer program for optimal assignment and scheduling, and we propose polynomial-time heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithms for larger networks. We evaluate our algorithms on the public transit service of Chattanooga, TN using operational data collected from transit vehicles. Our results show that the proposed algorithms are scalable and can reduce energy use and, hence, environmental impact and operational costs. For Chattanooga, the proposed algorithms can save $145,635 in energy costs and 576.7 metric tons of CO2 emission annually.",38951062,38951102,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-8975.SivagnanamA.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,J,1,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=8975
AISI-9334,AI for Social Impact,Traffic Flow Forecasting with Spatial-Temporal Graph Diffusion Network,Xiyue Zhang|Chao Huang|Yong Xu|Lianghao Xia|Peng Dai|Liefeng Bo|Junbo Zhang|Yu Zheng,"Accurate forecasting of citywide traffic flow has been playing critical role in a variety of spatial-temporal mining applications, such as intelligent traffic control and public risk assessment. While previous work has made significant efforts to learn traffic temporal dynamics and spatial dependencies, two key limitations exist in current models: i) Most of these methods solely focus on neighboring spatial correlations among adjacent regions, and ignore the global  geographical contextual information; ii) These methods fail to encode the complex traffic transition regularities exhibited with time-dependent and multi-resolution in nature. To tackle these challenges, we propose a new traffic flow prediction framework--Spatial-Temporal Graph Diffusion Network. In particular, ST-GDN is a hierarchically structured graph neural architecture which learns not only the local region-wise geographical dependencies, but also the spatial semantics from a global perspective. Furthermore, a multi-scale attention network is developed to empower ST-GDN with the capability of capturing multi-level temporal dynamics. Experiments on four real-life traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-GDN outperforms different types of state-of-the-art baselines consistently.",38951063,38951103,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-9334.ZhangX.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,D,B,AB-D2-R2,A,6,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=9334
AISI-9345,AI for Social Impact,Real-Time Tropical Cyclone Intensity Estimation by Handling Temporally Heterogeneous Satellite Data,Boyo Chen|Buo-Fu Chen|Yun-Nung Chen,"Analyzing big geophysical observational data collected by multiple advanced sensors on various satellite platforms promotes our understanding of the geophysical system. For instance, convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success in estimating tropical cyclone (TC) intensity based on satellite data with fixed temporal frequency (e.g., ~3 h). However, to achieve more timely (under 30 min) and accurate TC intensity estimates, a deep learning model is demanded to handle temporally-heterogeneous satellite observations. Specifically, infrared (IR1) and water vapor (WV) images are available within every 15 minute period, while passive microwave rain rate (PMW) is available about every 3 hours. Meanwhile, the visible (VIS) channel is severely affected by noise and sunlight intensity, making it difficult to be utilized.Therefore, we propose a novel framework that combines generative adversarial network (GAN) with CNN. The model utilizes all data during the training phase including VIS and PMW information and eventually uses only the high-frequent IR1 and WV data for providing intensity estimates during the predicting phase. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid GAN-CNN framework achieves comparable precision to the state-of-the-art models, while possessing the capability of increasing the maximum estimation frequency from 3 hours to less than 15 minutes.",38951064,38951104,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-9345.ChenB.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,A,A,AC-D2-R1,H,5,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=9345
AISI-9362,AI for Social Impact,Court Opinion Generation from Case Fact Description with Legal Basis,Quanzhi Li|Qiong Zhang,"In this study, we proposed an approach to automatically generating court view from the fact description of a legal case. This is a text-to-text natural language generation problem, and it can help the automatic legal document generation. Due to the specialty of the legal domain, our model exploits the charge and law article information in the generation process, instead of utilizing just the fact description text. The BERT model is used as the encoder and a Transformer architecture is used as decoder. To smoothly integrate these two parts together, we employ two separate optimizers for the two components during the training process. The experiments on two data sets of Chinese legal cases show that our approach outperforms other methods.",38951065,38951105,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-9362.LiQ.pdf,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,5-Feb,04:45PM-06:30PM,C,C,BC-D2-R1,K,4,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=9362
AISI-9414,AI for Social Impact,HateXplain: A Benchmark Dataset for Explainable Hate Speech Detection,Binny Mathew|Punyajoy Saha|Seid Muhie Yimam|Chris Biemann|Pawan Goyal|Animesh Mukherjee,"Hate speech is a challenging issue plaguing the online social media. While better models for hate speech detection are continuously being developed, there is little research on the bias and interpretability aspects of hate speech. In this paper, we introduce HateXplain, the first benchmark hate speech dataset covering multiple aspects of the issue. Each post in our dataset is annotated from three different perspectives: the basic, commonly used 3-class classification (i.e., hate, offensive or normal), the target community (i.e., the community that has been the victim of hate speech/offensive speech in the post), and the rationales, i.e., the portions of the post on which their labelling decision (as hate, offensive or normal) is based. We utilize existing state-of-the-art models and observe that even models that perform very well in classification do not score high on explainability metrics like model plausibility and faithfulness. We also observe that models, which utilize the human rationales for training, perform better in reducing unintended bias towards target communities. We have made our code and dataset public for other researchers.",38951066,38951106,https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/AISI-9414.MathewB.pdf,6-Feb,12:45AM-02:30AM,5-Feb,08:45AM-10:30AM,D,B,AB-D2-R2,B,7,AI for Social Impact,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=9414
