EAAI-6,Random Forests for Opponent Hand Estimation in Gin Rummy,Anthony Hein|May Jiang|Vydhourie Thiyageswaran|Michael Guerzhoy,"We demonstrate an AI agent for the card game of Gin Rummy. The agent uses simple heuristics in conjunction with a model that predicts the probability of each card's being in the opponent's hand. To estimate the probabilities for cards' being in the opponent's hand, we generate a dataset of Gin Rummy games using self-play, and train a random forest on the game information states. We explore the random forest classifier we trained and study the correspondence between its outputs and intuitively correct outputs. Our agent wins 61% of games against a baseline heuristic agent that does not use opponent hand estimation.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-6.HeinA.pdf
EAAI-16,Applied Machine Learning for Games: A Graduate School Course,Yilei Zeng|Aayush Shah|Jameson Thai|Michael Zyda,"The game industry is moving into an era where old-style game engines are being replaced by re-engineered systems with embedded machine learning technologies for the operation, analysis and understanding of game play. In this paper, we describe our machine learning course designed for graduate students interested in applying recent advances of deep learning and reinforcement learning towards gaming. This course serves as a bridge to foster interdisciplinary collaboration among graduate schools and does not require prior experience designing or building games. Graduate students enrolled in this course apply different fields of machine learning techniques such as computer vision, natural language processing, computer graphics, human computer interaction, robotics and data analysis to solve open challenges in gaming. Student projects cover use-cases such as training AI-bots in gaming benchmark environments and competitions, understanding human decision patterns in gaming, and creating intelligent non-playable characters or environments to foster engaging gameplay. Projects demos can help students open doors for an industry career, aim for publications, or lay the foundations of a future product. Our students gained hands-on experience in applying state of the art machine learning techniques to solve real-life problems in gaming.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-16.ZengY.pdf
EAAI-18,Extracting Learned Discard and Knocking Strategies from a Gin Rummy Bot,Benjamin Goldstein|Jean-Pierre Astudillo Guerra|Emily Haigh|Bryan Cruz Ulloa|Jeremy Blum,"Various Gin Rummy strategy guides provide heuristics for human players to improve their gameplay. Often these heuristics are either conflicting or contain ambiguity that limits their applicability, especially for discard and end-of-game decisions. This paper describes an approach to analyzing the machine learning capabilities of a Gin Rummy agent to help resolve these conflicts and ambiguities. There are three main decision points in the game: when to draw from the discard pile, which card to discard from the player's hand, and when to knock. The agent uses a learning approach to estimate the expected utility for discards. An analysis of these utility values provides insight into resolving ambiguities in tips for discard decisions in human play. The agent’s end-of-game, or knocking, strategy was derived using Monte Carlo Counterfactual regret minimization (MCCFR). This approach was applied to estimate Nash equilibrium knocking strategies under different rules of the game. The analysis suggests that conflicts in the end-of-game playing tips are due in part to different rules used in common Gin Rummy variants.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-18.GoldsteinB.pdf
EAAI-20,Teaching Tech to Talk: K-12 Conversational Artificial Intelligence Literacy Curriculum and Development Tools,Jessica Van Brummelen|Tommy Heng|Viktoriya Tabunshchyk,"With children talking to smart-speakers, smart-phones and even smart-microwaves daily, it is increasingly important to educate students on how these agents work—from underlying mechanisms to societal implications. Researchers are developing tools and curriculum to teach K-12 students broadly about artificial intelligence (AI); however, few studies have evaluated these tools with respect to AI-specific learning outcomes, and even fewer have addressed student learning about AI-based conversational agents. We evaluated our Conversational Agent Interface for MIT App Inventor and workshop curriculum with respect to 8 AI competencies from the literature. Furthermore, we analyze teacher (n=9) and student (n=47) feedback from workshops with the interface and recommend that future work (1) leverages design considerations to optimize engagement, (2) collaborates with teachers, and (3) addresses a range of student abilities through pacing and opportunities for extension. We found evidence for student understanding of all 8 competencies, with the most difficult concepts being AI ethics and machine learning. We recommend emphasizing these topics in future curricula.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-20.VanBrummelenJ.pdf
EAAI-21,A Heuristic Evaluation Function for Hand Strength Estimation in Gin Rummy,Aqib Ahmed|Joshua Leppo|Michal Lesniewski|Riken Patel|Jonathan Perez|Jeremy J. Blum,"This paper describes a fast hand strength estimation mod-el for the game of Gin Rummy. The algorithm is computationally inexpensive, and it incorporates not only cards in the player’s hand but also cards known to be in the op-ponent’s hand, cards in the discard pile, and the current game stage. This algorithm is used in conjunction with counterfactual regret (CFR) minimization to develop a gin rummy bot. CFR strategies were developed for the knock-ing strategies. The hand strength estimation algorithm was used to select a discard that balances the goals of maximizing the utility of the player’s hand and minimizing the likelihood that a card will be useful to the opponent. A study of the parameterization of this estimation algorithm demonstrates the soundness of approach as well as good performance under a wide range of parameter values.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-21.AhmedA.pdf
EAAI-23,Visualizing NLP in Undergraduate Students' Learning about Natural Language,Cecilia Ovesdotter Alm|Alex Hedges,"We report on the use of open-source natural language processing capabilities in a web-based interface to allow undergraduate students to apply what they have learned about formal natural language structures. The learning activities encourage students to interpret data in new ways, think originally about natural language, and critique the backend NLP models and algorithms visualized on the user front end. This work is of relevance to AI resources developed for education by focusing on inclusivity of students from many disciplinary backgrounds. Specifically, we comprehensively extended a web-based system with new resources. To test the students' reactions to NLP analyses that offer insights into both the strengths and limitations of AI systems, we incorporated a range of automated analyses focused on language-independent processing or meaning representations which still represent challenges for NLP. We conducted a survey-based evaluation with students in open-ended case-based assignments in undergraduate coursework. Responses indicated that the students reinforced their knowledge, applied critical thinking about language and NLP applications, and used the application not to solve the assignment for them, but as a tool in their own effort to address the task. We further discuss how using interpretable visualizations of system decisions is an opportunity to learn about ethical issues in NLP, and how making AI systems interpretable may broaden multidisciplinary interest in AI in early educational experiences.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-23.AlmCO.pdf
EAAI-25,Estimating Card Fitness for Discard in Gin Rummy,Jacob Gallucci|Richard Bowser|Sarah Kettell|Christian Overton,"Due to the computation time and resources required, there is no known optimal strategy for the game of Gin Rummy. Previous work in extensive games, such as Texas Hold ’em Poker, has found that hand fitness and information sets about the state of the game can be used to determine an improved strategy. These information sets, combined with algorithms for Counterfactual Regret Minimization, can arrive at a Nash Equilibrium strategy for smaller abstractions of extensive games. This paper builds on previous research by extending the premise of hand fitness to card fitness in the discard decision point of Gin Rummy. We argue that a card can be ranked based on whether it meets four specific characteristics at that stage in the game. These characteristics include its effect on deadwood points after one more turn, its utility to the opponent, and if it can contribute to a meld. An optimal discard choice can then be picked from the highest-ranked card by using a simplified Counterfactual regret minimization strategy that can be trained in less time due to its limited information set. While this does not look at every potential characteristic of card fitness, it outperformed other bots when evaluated in a large number of games. These bots did not consider card fitness as a whole, but rather considered characteristics separately. We argue that the characteristics defined are a part of the total information set that can determine the discard fitness of a card within a hand in the game of Gin Rummy.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-25.GallucciJ.pdf
EAAI-26,AI-Infused Collaborative Inquiry in Upper Elementary School: A Game-Based Learning Approach,Seung Lee|Bradford Mott|Anne Ottenbreit-Leftwich|Adam Scribner|Sandra Taylor|Kyungjin Park|Jonathan Rowe|Krista Glazewski|Cindy E. Hmelo-Silver|James Lester,"Artificial intelligence has emerged as a technology that is profoundly reshaping society and enabling rapid improvements in science, engineering, and mathematics, as well as information technology itself. This has generated increased demand for fostering an AI-literate populace as well as a growing recognition of the importance of promoting K-12 students’ awareness and interest in AI. Although efforts are be-ginning to incorporate AI learning within K-12 education, there is little research exploring how to introduce students to AI and how to support teachers to integrate AI learning experiences in their classrooms. This is especially true at the elementary school level. A particularly promising approach for providing effective and engaging AI learning experiences for elementary students is game-based learning. In this paper, we explore how to introduce AI-infused collaborative inquiry learning into upper elementary school (student ages 8 to 11) using game-based learning. To ground the work in the realities of elementary school classrooms, we present insights from interviews with elementary school teachers to under-stand how best to support them in integrating AI into their classrooms. We then present the design of PrimaryAI, a game-based learning environment that supports rich problem-based learning activities within upper elementary classrooms centered on AI applied toward solving life-science problems. Finally, we discuss some of the challenges we face in bringing AI-infused collaborative inquiry learning to upper elementary students.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-26.LeeS.pdf
EAAI-28,Evaluating Gin Rummy Hands Using Opponent Modeling and Myopic Meld Distance,Phoebe Goldman|Corey R. Knutson|Ryan Mahtab|Jack Maloney|Joseph B. Mueller|Richard G. Freedman,"Gin Rummy is a popular two-player card game involving choices to draw and discard cards to form sets of matching cards. Unlike other popular games such as Chess, Poker, and Go, there is little formal artificial intelligence research about how to make good decisions when playing Gin Rummy.  In this paper, we develop an agent that plays Gin Rummy through a combination of known and expected card values, modeling the opponent to predict their cards of interest, and a conservative approach to assessing when to end the hand.  In addition to discussing our observations about Gin Rummy that inspired our agent's design and how the agent works, we evaluate the relative importance of various features employed by our agent by competing agents which implement various subsets of those features.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-28.GoldmanP.pdf
EAAI-37,A Highly-Parameterized Ensemble to Play Gin Rummy,Masayuki Nagai|Kavya Shrivastava|Kien Ta|Steven Bogaerts|Chad Byers,"This paper describes the design and training of a computer Gin Rummy player. The system includes three main components to make decisions about drawing cards, discarding, and ending the game, with numerous parameters controlling behavior. In particular, an ensemble approach is explored in the discard decision. Finally, three sets of parameter tuning and performance experiments are analyzed.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-37.NagaiM.pdf
EAAI-41,What Are GANs?: Introducing Generative Adversarial Networks to Middle School Students,Safinah Ali|Daniella DiPaola|Cynthia Breazeal,"Applications of Generative Machine Learning techniques such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used to generate new instances of images, music, text, and videos. While GANs have now become commonplace on social media, a part of children’s lives, and have considerable ethical implications, existing K-12 AI education curricula do not include generative AI. We present a new module, “What are GANs?”, that teaches middle school students how GANs work and how they can create media using GANs. We developed an online, team-based game to simulate how GANs work. Students also interacted with up to four web tools that apply GANs to generate media. This module was piloted with 72 middle school students in a series of online workshops. We provide insight into student usage, understanding, and attitudes towards this lesson. Finally, we give suggestions for integrating this lesson into AI education curricula.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-41.AliS.pdf
EAAI-42,Designing a Hybrid AI Residency,Felipe Leno Da Silva|Silvio Stanzani|Jefferson Fialho|Jorge Mondadori|Muriel Mazzetto|Felipe Sanches Couto|Raphael Cobe,"The industry demand for AI experts raised to unprecedented levels in the last years. However, the increasing demand was not met by the number of skilled professionals in this area. As an effort to mitigate this problem, many companies create AI residency programs to provide in-house practical training. However, we argue that the usual dynamics based on one-on-one mentorship in those programs is very hard to scale and insufficient to meet the demand for AI professionals. In this paper, we describe a hybrid AI residency program that connects educational institutions, partner companies, and prospective residents. This program is designed to be funded by partner companies.Residents are exposed to practical projects of industry interest and are instructed on AI techniques and tools. We describe how we implemented our program, the challenges involved, and the lessons learned after the conclusion of the first residency class. Our program was developed to be inclusive and scalable, and resulted in a high employment rate for our alumni. Furthermore, several partner companies invested in in-house AI teams after the residency, resulting in direct benefits for our local AI community.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-42.SilvaFLD.pdf
EAAI-43,Teacher Perspectives on How to Train Your Robot: A Middle School AI and Ethics Curriculum,Randi Williams|Stephen P Kaputsos|Cynthia Breazeal,"To enable a diverse citizenry to fully participate in future society, we must prepare all students to construct and critique emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI). Classrooms are important spaces to teach students these skills, however there are few AI curricula that have been developed for and used by K-12 teachers. We developed the \textit{How to Train Your Robot: AI and Ethics Curriculum} for middle school teachers who want to introduce AI to their students. This paper describes the curriculum and professional development we used to prepare teachers to run a five-day AI course. Before and after they ran the curriculum, we interviewed teachers to understand their opinions on pedagogical approaches to teaching AI, meeting students' needs, and the feasibility of doing the activities in the classroom. Our results indicate that, with appropriate training, even teachers who were new to computer science felt prepared and successfully engaged their students in the topic. We hope our insights will inform future efforts to realize AI education in primary and secondary classrooms.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-43.WilliamsR.pdf
EAAI-47,Web-Based Platform for K-12 AI Education in China,Chao Wu|Yan Li|Junxiang Li|Qiongdan Zhang|Fei Wu,"As human beings are entering the era in which AI be-comes the new engine to drive social, economic, and sci-entific advancement, education is intensively being re-quired to adapt to this trend, to equip current and next generation with necessary knowledge, skills, and think-ing. Although AI education has achieved relative success in universities and cultivated a large number of talents and companies in the past decade, it hasn't made signifi-cant progress in K-12 education. We identify the key challenges as two gaps, one is about transferring practice from university education to K-12 education, and the other is about the inequal distribution of AI educational resources. To fill these gaps and to efficiently facilitate K-12 AI education, especially in countries like China, we designed and implemented a Web-based platform, which as a focal and sharing point of K-12 educational resources to provide essential AI learning and exercising components to both students and instructors. With this platform, we've successfully conducted a series of initial trials and gained positive feedbacks. We believe a wider-range application of the platform will achieve promising results for K-12 AI education.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-47.WuC.pdf
EAAI-51,Introduction to Machine Learning with Robots and Playful Learning,Viktoriya Olari|Kostadin Cvejoski|Øyvind Eide,"Inspired by explanations of machine learning concepts in children’s books, we developed an approach to introduce supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning using a block-based programming language in combination with the benefits of educational robotics. Instead of using blocks as high-end APIs to access AI cloud services or to reproduce the machine learning algorithms, we use them as a means to put the student “in the algorithm’s shoes.” We adapt the training of neural networks, Q-learning, and k-means algorithms to a design and format suitable for children and equip the students with hands-on tools for playful experimentation. The children learn about direct supervision by modifying the weights in the neural networks and immediately observing the effects on the simulated robot. Following the ideas of constructionism, they experience how the algorithms and underlying machine learning concepts work in practice. We conducted and evaluated this approach with students in primary, middle, and high school. All the age groups perceived the topics to be very easy to moderately hard to grasp. Younger students experienced direct supervision as challenging, whereas they found Q-learning and k-means algorithms much more accessible. Most high-school students could cope with all the topics without particular difficulties.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-51.OlariV.pdf
EAAI-53,The Contour to Classification Game,Irene Lee|Safinah Ali,"The Contour to Classification game is a browser-based game that teaches middle school students basic concepts in supervised learning. The game is an online variant of the Neural Network game that was presented at AAAI Fall Symposium Teaching AI in K-12 track in 2019. We share preliminary findings from implementing the online version of  the original  Neural Network game in a pilot research study and describe the game’s evolution to the Contour to Classification game. The new game uses a simulation of a neural network to engage students, through digital drawing and selection interactions, in the classification of images. The players act as nodes in a multi-step process of compositing salient smaller features to form larger features and ultimately a partial contour of an object that is used to make a prediction. After evaluating the prediction, information is sent back through the network in processes mimicking back propagation and gradient descent. Additional rounds of the game can be played to witness how the network evolves and gets “better” at classifying images from contours. Through this game, we aimed for students to learn the structure, components, and functioning of a neural network, and the processes involved in supervised learning. The Contour to Classification game supports online student learning by providing the image classification experience using purely visual inputs to each layer. We will conclude with a discussion of if and how the evolving design addresses classroom needs and scaling considerations.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-53.LeeI.pdf
EAAI-65,"Educational Question Mining At Scale: Prediction, Analysis and Personalization",Zichao Wang|Sebastian Tschiatschek|Simon Woodhead|José Miguel Hernández-Lobato|Simon Peyton Jones|Richard G. Baraniuk|Cheng Zhang,"Online education platforms enable teachers to share a large number of educational resources such as questions to form exercises and quizzes for students. With large volumes of available questions, it is important to have an automated way to quantify their properties and intelligently select them for students, enabling effective and personalized learning experiences. In this work, we propose a framework for mining insights from educational questions at scale. We utilize the state-of-the-art Bayesian deep learning method, in particular partial variational auto-encoders (p-VAE), to analyze real students' answers to a large collection of questions. Based on p-VAE, we propose two novel metrics that quantify question quality and difficulty, respectively, and a personalized strategy to adaptively select questions for students. We apply our proposed framework to a real-world dataset with tens of thousands of questions and tens of millions of answers from an online education platform. Our framework not only demonstrates promising results in terms of statistical metrics but also obtains highly consistent results with domain experts' evaluation.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-65.WangZ.pdf
EAAI-66,Heisenbot: A Rule-Based Game Agent for Gin Rummy,Matthew Eicholtz|Savanna Moss|Matt Traino|Christian Roberson,"Games are an excellent tool for undergraduate research in artificial intelligence because they typically have clear objectives, a limited action space, and well-defined constraints. Nonetheless, games involving chance and imperfect information offer unique challenges for optimizing gameplay. In this paper, we analyze one such card game, gin rummy, and propose an artificial intelligence player based on empirically driven strategies. Our approach separates gameplay into three disjoint policies for drawing, discarding, and knocking. On each turn, decisions are influenced by offensive considerations as well as defensive moves. Tournament-style simulations enable us to determine statistically which combination of policies achieves the highest win rate. Our resulting player, dubbed Heisenbot, is competitive against strong baseline strategies.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-66.EicholtzM.pdf
EAAI-67,Modeling Expert Knowledge in a Heuristic-Based Gin Rummy Agent,Sarah Larkin|William Collicott|Jason Hiebel,"We developed a heuristic-based reflex agent, Tonic, for the EAAI 2021 Undergraduate Research Challenge, which tasks competitors to create an autonomous player to play the card game gin rummy.  Tonic's heuristics originate in expert knowledge and inform decision making for the three actions comprising a turn: drawing a card, discarding a card, and deciding when to knock.  However, because these strategies are based in human intuition, there is often a lack of specificity to directly model them as algorithms.  We developed parameterized models describing that intuition based on factors such as the number of turns played and an estimation of the opponent hand.  To hone their performance, we conducted both manual analysis and parameter optimization (grid search) using self-play and play against a simple baseline agent.  These heuristic models enable Tonic to win against the baseline agent at least 68% of the time.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-67.LarkinS.pdf
EAAI-68,Deep Discourse Analysis for Generating Personalized Feedback in Intelligent Tutor Systems,Matt Grenander|Robert Belfer|Ekaterina Kochmar|Iulian V. Serban|François St-Hilaire|Jackie C. K. Cheung,"We explore creating automated, personalized feedback in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). Our goal is to pinpoint correct and incorrect concepts in student answers in order to achieve better student learning gains. Although automatic methods for providing personalized feedback exist, they do not explicitly inform students about which concepts in their answers are correct or incorrect. Our approach involves decomposing students answers using neural discourse segmentation and classification techniques. This decomposition yields a relational graph over all discourse units covered by the reference solutions and student answers. We use this inferred relational graph structure and a neural classifier to match student answers with reference solutions and generate personalized feedback. Although the process is completely automated and data-driven, the personalized feedback generated is highly contextual, domain-aware and effectively targets each student's misconceptions and knowledge gaps. We test our method in a dialogue-based ITS and demonstrate that our approach results in high-quality feedback and significantly improved student learning gains.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-68.GrenanderM.pdf
EAAI-71,PoseBlocks: A Toolkit for Creating (and Dancing) with AI,Brian Jordan|Nisha Devasia|Jenna Hong|Randi Williams|Cynthia Breazeal,"Body-tracking artificial intelligence (AI) systems like Kinect games, Snapchat Augmented Reality (AR) Lenses, and Instagram AR Filters are some of the most engaging ways students experience AI in their everyday lives. Additionally, many students have existing interests in physical hobbies like sports and dance. In this paper, we present PoseBlocks; a suite of block-based programming tools which enable students to build compelling body-interactive AI projects in any web browser, integrating camera/microphone inputs and body-sensing user interactions. To accomplish this, we provide a custom block-based programming environment building on the open source Scratch project, introducing new AI-model-powered blocks supporting body, hand, and face tracking, emotion recognition, and the ability to integrate custom image/pose/audio models from the online transfer learning tool Teachable Machine. We introduce editor functionality such as a project video recorder, pre-computed video loops, and integration with curriculum materials. We discuss deploying this toolkit with an accompanying curriculum in a series of synchronous online pilots with 46 students, aged 9-14. In analyzing class projects and discussions, we find that students learned to design, train, and integrate machine learning models in projects of their own devising while exploring ethical considerations such as stakeholder values and algorithmic bias in their interactive AI systems.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-71.JordanB.pdf
EAAI-75,GANs Unplugged,Patrick Virtue,"With the influx of deepfake and style transfer technology in today's news and social media, everyone is told that these applications are powered by artificial intelligence and deep learning, but too often the explanation of how it works goes no further. Rather than waiting until second semester of computer science grad school to learn about generative adversarial networks (GANs), we propose a classroom activity to introduce GANs to secondary school students. Our GANs Unplugged activity steps outside a traditional classroom environment and forms groups of students that physically act as the various components of a GAN. Students in the Real and Generator (i.e. Fake) groups both draw sketches of animals on index cards, but only the Real group has the secret, specific instructions on how to draw their animals. A third Discriminator group tries to determine if each card it receives came from the Real group or the Fake group. The Discriminator group also makes a single feedback mark on the drawing to suggest how that drawing could be more ""real"" before passing the card back to the group that drew it. As this game progresses, the Discriminators get better at determining real and fake, that is until the Generators adapt and learn to draw more and more realistic fake"" images. We describe the details of GANs Unplugged and present our experience running this activity at three different artificial intelligence summer camps for high school students.""",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-75.VirtueP.pdf
EAAI-78,Learning Artificial Intelligence: Insights into How Youth Encounter and Build Understanding of AI Concepts,Eric Greenwald|Maxyn Leitner|Ning Wang,"Artificial Intelligence’s impact on society is increasingly pervasive. While innovative educational programs are being developed, there has been little understanding of how students, especially pre-college aged students, construct understanding and gain practice with core ideas about AI or what concepts are most appropriate for what age-levels. In this paper, we discuss a cognitive interview study with high school students to better understand how students learn AI concepts. We aim to shed light on questions including: what is the range of background knowledge and experiences students are able to apply in encountering AI concepts; what concepts are most readily accessible and which are more challenging; what misconceptions do students bring to bear on AI problems; and how to help students approach AI concepts by leveraging related concepts, such as mathematical and computational thinking). Results from the exploratory study have the potential to provide important insights into AI learning for pre-college youth.

A significant teacher-student interaction without observing students' academic status is undesirable in the constructivist view on education. To remedy teachers' hardships in estimating students' knowledge state, we propose a Student Knowledge Prediction Framework that models and explains student's knowledge state for teachers. The knowledge state of a student is modeled to predict the future mastery level on a knowledge concept. The proposed framework is integrated into an e-learning application as a measure of automated feedback. We verified the applicability of the assessment framework through an expert survey.

EAAI-96,Opponent Hand Estimation in Gin Rummy Using Deep Neural Networks and Heuristic Strategies,Bhaskar Mishra|Ashish Aggarwal,"A vital part of any good strategy for most imperfect-information games is making predictions about the information that is unavailable. For example, in card games like Poker and Gin Rummy, predicting the kinds of cards the opponent is holding is necessary for playing well. Specifically, it is useful for agents to be able to map the partial game states that are made available to them to the probabilities of each of the possible complete game states, given that they are playing against other rational player(s). Finding this relationship, however, is difficult, as it requires knowledge of how a rational player would play, which is the problem this relationship is being used to solve. In this paper, we attempt to find this relationship in the context of the card game Gin Rummy, though instead of predicting the complete game state, we focus on what is most useful to a player: the opponent's hand. We do this by using heuristic utility functions to create an agent that approximates how a rational player would play, and then using the resulting game data to train a Deep Neural Network mapping known information to predictions about the opponent's hand. This model is used to improve the existing agent and, in turn, to produce more data to create better models.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/EAAI-96.MishraB.pdf
