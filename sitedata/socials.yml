- name: Accelerating the Pipeline of Trailblazing STEM Students
  description: |-
    We will discuss needs, best practices, and research to help trailblazing students pursue careers in AI. Trailblazers are high-potential students from under-resourced backgrounds (e.g., first-generation, low-income), under-represented backgrounds (e.g., African American, Latinx, Native American, women), and others with limited exposure to research opportunities or mentoring. These learners represent a highly capable, under-utilized resource.
    We will highlight a successful pilot program called “Cohort-based Integrated Research Community for Undergraduate Innovation and Trailblazing” (CIRCUIT - www.circuitinstitute.org) at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory that aims to create a new talent pipeline facilitating the transition of trailblazing undergraduate students into advanced STEM degrees and careers, while achieving mission impact.
    Our workshop will provide an avenue for discussion and potential solutions, including opportunities related to virtual education and the COVID-19 pandemic.

  description: The highlight of this event is a fireside chat with Dr. Ayanna Howard (Georgia Institute of Technology), an accomplished American roboticist, entrepreneur and educator. We will discuss her latest book "Sex, Race, and Robots," in which she explores how the tech world’s racial and sexual biases are infecting the next generation of Artificial Intelligence, with profoundly negative effects for humans of all genders and races.

- name: Gender Identity and AI
  description: "As AI-driven systems become the de-facto drivers of human interactions, they risk making assumptions about gender identity that alienates people who do not see themselves represented. To acknowledge and respect a broader scope of gender identities, change is needed in how we develop the systems that drive our world. The key question we hope to explore during this workshop is: \"How can AI systems be developed that better represent and include all gender identities?\" We are interested in discussing the full AI/ML pipeline, including data collection, data analysis and interpretation, and representations of AI systems and agents, which can propagate stereotypes. Everyone is invited to the presentations, but we will limit the number of participants in the breakout sessions to keep them manageable. Interested participants should sign up for the breakouts on the workshop website."

- name: 2021 Mid-Career Diversity Virtual Discussion (MIDCAR)
  description: "MIDCAR is an event for minority members at mid-career levels. The goals of MIDCAR 2021 are: 1) Increase awareness of potential disadvantages faced by minorities and of actions to take to neutralize them at mid-career levels; 2) Strengthen the ties between underrepresented AAAI members at mid-career levels; and 3) Revitalize our group and create sharable repositories so that together we can overcome challenges. Please join us if you need or are willing to offer help. This is our second event. We learned important strategies last year from senior AAAI members and we would like to share those strategies with you, and further discuss the challenges that stop many of us from being more assertive and from reaching our fair place at the academic-scientific table in our institutions and in our field."

- name: "Reframing Diversity in AI: Representation, Inclusion and Power"
  description: |-
    The number of minorities in the tech industry is disproportionately low when compared to the US and world population. This lack of diversity often leads to new technology and solutions that contribute to and sometimes amplify systemic racism. We maintain that part of the effort in increasing diversity in AI should be focused on reforming our perspectives, reshaping our institutions and enabling equitable participation and influence at every level of an organization or institution.
    The Reframing Diversity in AI: Representation, Inclusion, and Power workshop is a one-day event that will bring together academic and industrial researchers to explore, frame, and implement inclusive solutions across three topic areas:
    1. The use of technology to address systemic racism as a means to reduce historical barriers of opportunity
    2. The need for inclusion of members of key groups including Black and Latino individuals in the concept, design and testing of technical solutions
    3. Participation in key decision-making roles to influence all aspects of minority engagement

- name: The Second Workshop on Artificial Intelligence – Diversity, Belonging, Equity, and Inclusion (AIDBEI)
  description: This workshop is the second in the series of workshops organized by Diverse In AI, an affinity group which aims to foster links between participants from underrepresented populations, which in artificial intelligence includes but is not limited to women, LGBTQ+ persons, and people of color (e.g., Black in AI, WiML, LatinX in AI, Queer in AI). This workshop aims to bring together these communities to strive to achieve the intersecting goals through interdisciplinary collaborations. This shall help in the dissemination of benefits to all underserved communities in the field of AI and further help in mentoring students/future technologists belonging to isolated, underprivileged, and underrepresented communities. The workshop will include some presentations, a panel discussion, and an online social event open to everyone, using the gather town software for one-to-one and many-to-many interaction and networking through multiple communities. A mentoring sub-event will be offered to junior attendees during the online social event in order to encourage interactions.
