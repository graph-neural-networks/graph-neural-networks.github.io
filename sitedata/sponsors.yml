    **Babelscape** is a high-tech Sapienza startup company founded in 2016
    focused on **multilingual Natural Language Processing** with the main
    goal of **enabling multilinguality and text understanding** in customers’
    applications which deal with text in different ways.
    Thanks to technological transfer from the internationally renowned
    Natural Language Processing research group headed by *prof. Roberto
    Navigli* at the Sapienza University of Rome, **winner of two European
    Research Council grants and of several international awards**, the
    company places itself on the market with very high professional
    profiles and the ability to tailor its solutions to the customers' needs.
    The company's core mission is to **overcome the language barriers** by
    enabling the automatic processing of text **independently of the input
    language**, and distilling and aggregating the information extracted across
    languages by means of a unified large-scale multilingual knowledge repository
    and **semantically-enhanced text comprehension systems**.

#     Artificial intelligence could be one of humanity's most useful inventions. DeepMind aims to build advanced AI to expand our knowledge and find solutions to thousands of problems.

#     We’re a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. We use our technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethics are the highest priority.

#     We have a track record of breakthroughs in fundamental AI research, published in journals like Nature, Science, and more. Our programs have learned to diagnose eye diseases as effectively as the world’s top doctors, to save 30% of the energy used to keep data centres cool, and to make state of the art predictions of the complex 3D shapes of proteins - which could one day transform how drugs are invented.

#     DeepMind was founded in London in 2010, and we joined forces with Google in 2014 to accelerate our work. Since then, our community has expanded to include teams in Alberta, Montreal, Paris, and Mountain View in California.

#     Natural Language Processing (NLP) research at Google focuses on algorithms that apply at scale, across languages, and across domains. Our systems are used in numerous ways across Google, impacting user experience in search, mobile, apps, ads, translate and more. Our syntactic systems predict part-of-speech tags for each word in a given sentence, as well as morphological features such as gender and number. They also label relationships between words, such as subject, object, modification, and others. We focus on efficient algorithms that leverage large amounts of unlabeled data, and recently have incorporated neural net technology. On the semantic side, we identify entities in free text, label them with types (such as person, location, or organization), cluster mentions of those entities within and across documents (coreference resolution), and resolve the entities to the Knowledge Graph. To learn more about the research we’re presenting at EMNLP 2020, check out our [Accepted Papers](https://goo.gle/EMNLP-Accepted-Papers) and [Workshops and Tutorials](https://goo.gle/EMNLP-Workshops-Tutorials).
