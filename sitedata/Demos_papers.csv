DEMO-6,EasyRL: A Simple and Extensible Reinforcement Learning Framework,Neil Hulbert|Sam Spillers|Brandon Francis|James Haines-Temons|Ken Gil Romero|Benjamin De Jager|Sam Wong|Kevin Flora|Bowei Huang|Athirai A. Irissappane,"In recent years, Reinforcement Learning (RL), has become a popular field of study as well as a tool for enterprises working on cutting-edge artificial intelligence research. To this end, many researchers have built RL frameworks such as openAI Gym, and KerasRL for ease of use. While these works have made great strides towards bringing down the barrier of entry for those new to RL, we propose a much simpler framework called EasyRL, by providing an interactive graphical user interface for users to train and evaluate RL agents. As it is entirely graphical, EasyRL does not require programming knowledge for training and testing simple built-in RL agents. EasyRL also supports custom RL agents and environments, which can be highly beneficial for RL researchers in evaluating and comparing their RL models.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/DEMO-6.HulbertN.pdf,7-Feb,,,,Z,,DEMO-D4-A,A,1,Demonstrations,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=DEMO-6

DEMO-172,Democratizing Constraint Satisfaction Problems through Machine Learning,Mohit Kumar|Samuel Kolb|Clement Gautrais|Luc De Raedt,"Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are used widely, especially in the field of operations research, to model various real world problems like scheduling or planning. However,modelling a problem as a CSP is not trivial, it is labour intensive and requires both modelling and domain expertise. The emerging field of constraint learning deals with this problem by automatically  learning constraints from a given dataset. While there are several interesting approaches for constraint learning, these works are hard to access for a non-expert user. Furthermore, different approaches have different underlying formalism and require different setups before  they can be used. This demo paper combines these researches and brings it to non-expert users in the form of an interactive Excel plugin. To do this, we translate different formalism for specifying CSPs into a common language, which allows multiple constraint learners to coexist, making this plugin more powerful than individual constraint learners. Moreover, we integrate learning of CSPs from data with solving them, making it a self sufficient plugin.

DEMO-219,Bootstrapping Dialog Models from Human to Human Conversation Logs,Pankaj Dhoolia|Vineet Kumar|Danish Contractor|Sachindra Joshi,"State-of-the-art commercial dialog platforms provide powerful tools to build a conversational agent. These platforms provide complete control to the dialog designer to model user-agent interactions. However, a dialog designer needs to rely on domain experts to manually build the dialog model -- by creating dialog flow nodes and modeling user intents. This process is laborious, time consuming and expensive and does not allow the designer to exploit human to human conversation logs effectively. In this work, we present a research prototype that can ingest human-to-human conversation logs between an end-user and an agent, and suggest user-intents and agent-responses, given a conversation context. We utilize human to human conversation logs to build two emulators: user and agent. An agent emulator models an agent response given the conversation context so far, and a user emulator outputs possible user responses. Our system is able to recommend conversational  intents as well as conversation flow using emulators based on real-world data, thus making the process of designing a bot more efficient.

(2) world knowledge from YAGO, Freebase, DBpedia and Wikidata, which provides explicit knowledge about specific instances. (3) commonsense knowledge from ConceptNet, which describes implicit general facts. To model these different types of knowledge consistently, we introduce a three-level unified frame-styled representation architecture. To integrate free-form commonsense knowledge with other structured knowledge, we propose a strategy that combines automated labeling and crowdsourced annotation. At present, CogNet integrates 1,000+ semantic frames from linguistic KBs, 20,000,000+ frame instances from world KBs, as well as 90,000+ commonsense assertions from commonsense KBs. All these data can be easily queried and explored on our online platform, and free to download in RDF format for utilization under a CC-BY-SA 4.0 license.

DEMO-278,Doc2Bot: A Document Grounded Bot Framework,Kshitij Fadnis|Pankaj Dhoolia|Li Zhu|Q. Vera Liao|Steven Ross|Nathaniel Mills|Sachindra Joshi|Luis Lastras,"Conversational agents, or chatbots, are widely used to provide customer care and other informational support. Currently, the development of chatbots using standard frameworks requires a lot of manual crafting by subject matter experts (SMEs). On the other hand, while learning-based approaches to dialog have made significant advancements, they require training with a large volume of dialog data, which chatbot developers typically do not have access to. To tackle these challenges, we introduce DOC2BOT, a system that supports the automated construction of chatbots by digesting various forms of documents such as business manuals, HowTos, and customer support pages that organizations own. In addition to that, DOC2BOT provides a user-friendly experience to SMEs, and to minimize their effort by supporting intuitive interactions and streamlining their workflow.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/DEMO-278.FadnisK.pdf,7-Feb,,,,Z,,DEMO-D4-B,B,2,Demonstrations,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=DEMO-278

Kleinman|Pradeep Mangalath|Catherine Del Vecchio Fitz,"Thousands of scientific publications discuss evidence on the efficacy of non-cancer generic drugs being tested for cancer. However, trying to manually identify and extract such evidence is intractable at scale. We introduce a natural language processing pipeline to automate the identification of relevant studies and facilitate the extraction of therapeutic associations between generic drugs and cancers from PubMed abstracts. We annotate datasets of drug-cancer evidence and use them to train models to identify and characterize such evidence at scale. To make this evidence readily consumable, we incorporate the results of the models in a web application that allows users to browse documents and their extracted evidence. Users can provide feedback on the quality of the evidence extracted by our models. This feedback is used to improve our datasets and the corresponding models in a continuous integration system. We describe the natural language processing pipeline in our application and the steps required to deploy services based on the machine learning models.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/DEMO-284.BaldiniI.pdf,5-Feb,,,,Z,,DEMO-D2-D,D,2,Demonstrations,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=DEMO-284

DEMO-319,Demonstration of the EMPATHIC Framework for Task Learning from Implicit Human Feedback,Yuchen Cui|Qiping Zhang|Sahil Jain|Alessandro Allievi|Peter Stone|Scott Niekum|W. Bradley Knox,"Reactions such as gestures, facial expressions, and vocalizations are an abundant, naturally occurring channel of information that humans provide during interactions. An agent could leverage an understanding of such implicit human feedback to improve its task performance at no cost to the human. This approach contrasts with common agent teaching methods based on demonstrations, critiques, or other guidance that need to be attentively and intentionally provided. In this work, we demonstrate a novel data-driven framework for learning from implicit human feedback, EMPATHIC. This two-stage method onsists of (1) mapping implicit human feedback to relevant task statistics such as reward, optimality, and advantage; and (2) using such a mapping to learn a task.  We instantiate the first stage and three second-stage evaluations of the learned mapping. To do so, we collect a dataset of human facial reactions while participants observe an agent execute a sub-optimal policy for a prescribed training task. We train a deep neural network on this data and demonstrate its ability to (1) infer relative reward ranking of events in the training task from prerecorded human facial reactions; (2) improve the policy of an agent in the training task using live human facial reactions; and (3) transfer to a novel domain in which it evaluates robot manipulation trajectories. In the video, we focus on demonstrating the online learning capability of our instantiation of EMPATHIC.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/DEMO-319.CuiY.pdf,5-Feb,,,,Z,,DEMO-D2-E,E,2,Demonstrations,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=DEMO-319

Such systems must provide intuitive explanations when the suggestions made by these systems seem inexplicable to the human. In this regard, we consider scenarios where the user questions the system's suggestion by providing alternatives (referred to as foils). In response, we empower existing decision support technologies to engage in an interactive explanatory dialogue with the user and provide contrastive explanations based on user-specified foils to reach a consensus on proposed decisions. To provide contrastive explanations, we adapt existing techniques in Explainable AI Planning (XAIP). Furthermore, we use this dialog to elicit the user's latent preferences and propose three modes of interaction that use these preferences to provide revised plan suggestions.
