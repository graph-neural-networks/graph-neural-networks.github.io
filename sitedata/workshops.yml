  organizers: "Tanmoy Chakraborty, Kai Shu, H. Russell Bernard, Huan Liu, and Md Shad Akhtar"
  abstract: "Online hostile posts (e.g., hate speech, fake news, etc.) can have severe consequences, and therefore, its detection is of paramount importance for societal causes. Another important aspect is early detection and prevention of hostile posts in response to a critical/emergency situation (e.g., COVID-19, US presidential election) where the (mis)information spreads rapidly. Moreover, hostile posts are not limited to English; instead, they are available in a variety of regional/local languages (e.g., Indian, some European languages, etc.). The challenges in automatic identification of the hostile posts are more critical in case of these regional languages - primarily because of the lack of resources for such languages. With the CONSTRAINT-2021 workshop, we aim to attract the attention of the research communities to these important aspects of the hostile posts detection and provide a platform for the high-quality research in this domain."

  title: "W6: Commonsense Knowledge Graphs (CSKGs)"
  organizers: Filip Ilievski, Alessandro Oltramari, Deborah McGuinness and Pedro Szekely
  abstract: "Commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKGs) are sources of background knowledge that are expected to contribute to downstream tasks like question answering, robot manipulation, and planning. The knowledge covered in CSKGs varies greatly, spanning procedural, conceptual, and syntactic knowledge, among others. CSKGs come in a wider variety of forms compared to traditional knowledge graphs, ranging from (semi-)structured knowledge graphs, such as ConceptNet, ATOMIC, and FrameNet, to the recent idea to use language models as knowledge graphs. As a consequence, traditional methods of integration and usage of knowledge graphs might need to be expanded when dealing with CSKGs. Understanding how to best integrate and represent CSKGs, leverage them on a downstream task, and tailor their knowledge to the particularities of the task, are open challenges today. The workshop on CSKGs addresses these challenges, by focusing on the creation of commonsense knowledge graphs and their usage on downstream commonsense reasoning tasks."

  title: "W8: Deep Learning on Graphs: Method and Applications (DLG-AAAI’21)"
  organizers: Lingfei Wu, Jiliang Tang, Yinglong Xia and Jian Pei
  abstract: "Deep Learning models are at the core of research in Artificial Intelligence research today. It is well-known that deep learning techniques that were disruptive for Euclidean data such as images or sequence data such as text are not immediately applicable to graph-structured data. This gap has driven a tide in research for deep learning on graphs on various tasks such as graph representation learning, graph generation, and graph classification. This wave of research at the intersection of graph theory and deep learning has also influenced other fields of science, including computer vision, natural language processing, inductive logic programming, program synthesis and analysis, automated planning, reinforcement learning, and financial security. Despite these successes, graph neural networks (GNNs) still face many challenges. This one-day workshop aims to bring together both academic researchers and industrial practitioners from different backgrounds and perspectives to above challenges. This workshop intends to share visions of investigating new approaches and methods at the intersection of Graph Neural Networks and real-world applications."

  organizers: Balaraman Ravindran, Kristian Kersting, Sarika Jalan, Partha Pratim Talukdar, Sriraam Natarajan, Tarun Kumar, Deepak Maurya, Nikita Moghe, Naganand Yadati, Jeshuren Chelladurai and Aparna Rai
  abstract: "The study of complex graphs is a highly interdisciplinary field that aims to study complex systems using mathematical models, physical laws, inference and learning algorithms, etc. Complex systems are often characterized by several components that interact in multiple ways among each other. Such systems are better modeled by complex graph structures such as edge and vertex labeled graphs (e.g., knowledge graphs), attributed graphs, multilayer graphs, hypergraphs, etc. This workshop is focused on inference and learning algorithms on various complex structures, which is an active area of research in ML and network science community. This workshop aims to bring researchers from these diverse but related fields together and enable interesting discussions on new challenging applications that require complex system modeling and discovering ingenious reasoning methods. We have invited several distinguished speakers with their research interests spanning the theoretical and experimental aspects of complex networks."

  abstract: "Public health authorities and researchers collect data from many sources and analyze these data together to estimate the incidence and prevalence of different health conditions, as well as related risk factors. Modern surveillance systems employ tools and techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning to monitor direct and indirect signals and indicators of disease activities for early, automatic detection of emerging outbreaks and other health-relevant patterns. The advances in web science and technology for data management, integration, mining, classification, filtering, and visualization has given rise to a variety of applications representing real-time data on epidemics. Moreover, to tackle and overcome several issues in personalized healthcare, information technology will need to evolve to improve communication, collaboration, and teamwork among patients, their families, healthcare communities, and care teams involving practitioners from different fields and specialties. All of these changes require novel solutions and the AI community is well-positioned to provide both theoretical- and application-based methods and frameworks."

  title: 'W15: Imagining Post-COVID Education with AI'
  organizers: "Paul Kim, Neil Hefferman, Jineon Baek, Hoonpyo Jeon, Byungsoo Kim, Jamin Shin, Dongmin Shin and Youngduck Choi"
  abstract: "COVID-19 has brought upon us the inevitable transformation towards virtual education. The ensuing need for scalable, personalized learning systems has led to an unprecedented demand for understanding large-scale educational data. In this workshop, we invited AIEd enthusiasts from all around the world through three different channels. First, we called for papers related to important AIEd topics that can help us imagine what new education will look like. Second, we proposed various AIEd shared tasks using the largest public education dataset, EdNet, which contains 123M interactions from 1M+ students. Finally, we hosted a global challenge on Kaggle for a fair comparison of state-of-the-art Knowledge Tracing models and invited technical reports from winning teams. Through these initiatives, we aim to provide a common ground for researchers to share their cutting-edge insights on AIEd and encourage the development of practical and large-scale AIEd methods of lasting impact."

  title: "W16: Knowledge Discovery from Unstructured Data in Financial Services (KDF)"
  organizers: "Xiaomo Liu, Zhiqiang Ma, Manuela M. Veloso, Sameena Shah, Armineh Nourbakhsh, Gerard de Melo, Le Song and Quanzhi Li"
  abstract: "Knowledge discovery from various data sources has gained the attention of many practitioners over the past decades. Its capabilities have expanded from processing structured data (e.g. DB transactions) to unstructured data (e.g. text, images, and videos). In spite of substantial research focusing on discovery from news, web, and social media data, its application to data in professional settings such as legal documents, financial filings, and government reports, still present huge challenges. Possible reasons are that the precision and recall requirements for extracted knowledge to be used in business processes are fastidious, and signals gathered from these knowledge discovery tasks are usually very sparse and thus the generation of supervision signals is quite challenging."

  title: "W17: Learning Network Architecture during Training"
  organizers: Scott E. Fahlman, Kate Farrahi, George Magoulas, Edouard Oyallon, Bhiksha Raj Ramakrishnan and Dean Alderucci
  abstract: "A fundamental problem in the use of artificial neural networks is that the first step is to guess the network architecture. Fine tuning a neural network is very time consuming and far from optimal. Hyperparameters such as the number of layers, the number of nodes in each layer, the pattern of connectivity, and the presence and placement of elements such as memory cells, recurrent connections, and convolutional elements are all manually selected. If it turns out that the architecture is not appropriate for the task, the user must repeatedly adjust the architecture and retrain the network until an acceptable architecture has been obtained."

  title: "W18: Meta-Learning and Co-Hosted Competition"
  organizers: Adrian El Baz, Isabelle Guyon, Zhengying Liu, Jan N. van Rijn, Sebastien Treguer and Joaquin Vanschoren
  abstract: "The performance of many machine learning algorithms depends highly upon the quality and quantity of available data, and (hyper)-parameter settings. In particular, deep learning methods, including convolutional neural networks, are known to be ‘data-hungry,’ and require properly tuned hyper-parameters. Meta-Learning is a way to address both issues. Simple, but effective approaches reported recently include pre-training models on similar datasets. This way, a good model or good hyperparameters can be pre-determined or learned model parameters can be transferred to the new dataset. As such, higher performance can be achieved with the same amount of data, or similar performance with less data (few shot learning). This workshop, with a co-hosted competition, will focus on meta-learning and few shot learning."

  title: "W19: Meta-Learning for Computer Vision (ML4CV)"
  organizers: Mayank Vatsa, Richa Singh, Nalini Ratha, Vishal Patel and Surbhi Mittal
  abstract: "Machine learning and in particular deep learning has shown significant boost in performance on various computer vision tasks such as object recognition, face recognition, and semantic segmentation in the last decade. Despite this success, the learning mechanism of modern systems remains surprisingly narrow as compared to the way humans learn. For example, contrary to the most current systems which learn just a single model from just a single data set, we humans acquire knowledge from diverse experiences over many years. As an alternative, meta-learning and life-long learning aka never-ending learning has been emerging as a new paradigm in the machine learning literature."

  title: "W20: Plan, Activity, and Intent Recognition (PAIR) 2021"
  organizers: "Sarah Keren, Reuth Mirsky and Christopher Geib"
  abstract: "Plan recognition, activity recognition, and intent recognition all involve making inferences about other actors from observations of their behavior, i.e., their interaction with the environment and with each other. The observed actors may be software agents, robots, or humans. This synergistic area of research combines and unifies techniques from user modeling, planning, machine vision, intelligent user interfaces, human/computer interaction, autonomous and multi-agent systems, natural language understanding, and machine learning. It plays a crucial role in a wide variety of applications including assistive technology, computer and network security, human-robot collaboration and e-commerce. This workshop seeks to bring together researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, to share ideas and recent results in recognition research."

  organizers: "Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur, Ullas Nambiar, Imed Zitouni and Biplav Srivastava"
  abstract: "Natural conversation is a hallmark of intelligent systems and thus dialog systems have been a key sub-area of Artificial Intelligence research for decades. Chatbots are their most recent incarnation and have been widely adopted, particularly in the recent COVID-19 pandemic, as sources of information. Given the increasing interest, there has been a surge in the development of easy-to-use platforms to rapidly create dialog agents at different levels of sophistication. Further, with the rapid advances in natural language generation models, there is a need to foster and guide the research on the development and deployment of dialog systems with what users actually value."

  title: "W23: Reinforcement Learning in Games"
  organizers: Marc Lanctot, Julien Perolat and Martin Schmid
  abstract: "Games provide an abstract and formal model of environments in which multiple agents interact: each player has a well-defined goal and rules to describe the effects of interactions among the players. The first achievements in playing these games at super-human level were attained with methods that relied on and exploited domain expertise that was designed manually (e.g. chess, checkers). In recent years, we have seen examples of general approaches that learn to play these games via self-play reinforcement learning (RL), as first demonstrated in Backgammon. While progress has been impressive, we believe we have just scratched the surface of what is capable, and much work remains to be done in order to truly understand the algorithms and learning processes within these environments."

  title: "W26: Trustworthy AI for Healthcare"
  organizers: Pengtao Xie, Marinka Zitnik, Byron Wallace, Jennifer G. Dy and Eric Xing
  abstract: "AI for healthcare has emerged into a very active research area in the past few years and has made significant progress. While existing results are encouraging, not too many clinical AI solutions are deployed in hospitals or actively utilized by physicians. A major problem is that existing clinical AI methods are less trustworthy. For example, existing approaches make clinical decisions in a black-box way, which renders the decisions difficult to understand and less transparent. Existing solutions are not robust to small perturbations or potentially adversarial attacks, which raises security and privacy concerns. All these problems render the existing solutions less trustworthy. In this workshop, we aim to address the trustworthy issues of clinical AI solutions and facilitate discussions and collaborations in developing trustworthy AI methods that are reliable and more acceptable to physicians."
