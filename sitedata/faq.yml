      - Question: How can I best engage from my timezone?
#        Answer: "Participants and authors are spread out across the world, which adds a new challenge to enjoying the conference. The calendar displayed on the website is shown in your local time, and each event has a link for copying to your personal calendar. Start with the [Schedule](/schedule.html).\n\nHere is one hypothetical day for one hypothetical KDD member at the main conference:\n\nOn the first main conference day, Feb 4, as with every day, all videos for that day will have been released beforehand. For the first day, this includes the pre-recorded GC and PC welcome, the first plenary talk by Regina Barzilay, pre-recorded talks for the Business meeting, and the videos for the papers in the paper sessions for that day.\n\nA participant Maryam from Lagos (GMT+1) has bookmarked four talks she is particularly interested in today. She watches all 4 talks at 9am, and decides she would like to join the paper Q&A sessions for two of them, one at 10am and one at 2pm her time).
#        For a paper on discourse, she asks a question of the author on the paper's RocketChat channel. At noon, she visits a sponsor booth for IBM since she is interested in an internship. At 1pm, the author of the discourse paper pops into the Rocket Chat channel and replies to Maryam's RocketChat question. At 3 pm, Maryam joins the plenary session, including watching Regina Barzilay's invited talk and participating in the live Q&A session, where she can post questions for Kathy via RocketChat that the moderator can ask live in the question session. At 7pm, she goes to a Birds of a Feather meeting."
