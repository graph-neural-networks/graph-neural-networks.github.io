SA-11,Towards Sample Efficient Agents through Algorithmic Alignment,Mingxuan Li|Michael Littman,"In this work, we propose and explore Deep Graph Value Network (DeepGV) as a promising method to work around sample complexity in deep reinforcement-learning agents using a message-passing mechanism. The main idea is that the agent should be guided by structured non-neural-network algorithms like dynamic programming. According to recent advances in algorithmic alignment, neural networks with structured computation procedures can be trained efficiently. We demonstrate the potential of graph neural network in supporting sample efficient learning by showing that Deep Graph Value Network can outperform unstructured baselines by a large margin in solving Markov Decision Process (MDP). We believe this would open up a new avenue for structured agents design.

SA-69,Multi-label Few-shot Learning with Semantic Inference,Zhen Wang|Yiqun Duan|Liu Liu|Dacheng Tao,"Few-shot learning can adapt the classification model to new labels with only a few labeled examples. Previous studies mainly focus on the scenario of a single category label per example but have not solved the more challenging multi-label scenario with exponential-sized output space and low-data effectively. In this paper, we propose a semantic-aware meta-learning model for multi-label few-shot learning. Our approach can learn and infer the semantic correlation between unseen labels and historical labels to quickly adapt multi-label tasks from only a few examples. Specifically, features can be mapped into the semantic embedding space via label word vectors to explore and exploit the label correlation, and thus cope with the challenge on the overwhelming size of the output space. Then a novel semantic inference mechanism is designed for leveraging prior knowledge learned from historical labels, which will produce good generalization performance on new labels to alleviate the low-data problem. Finally, extensive empirical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on the multi-label few-shot learning tasks.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-69.WangZ.pdf,,4-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D1-B,B,1,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-69

Our method, logic-guided genetic algorithm (LGGA), takes as input a set of labelled data points and auxiliary truths (AT) (mathematical facts known a priori about the unknown function the regressor aims to learn) and outputs a specially generated and curated dataset that can be used with any SR method. We evaluate LGGA against state-of-the-art SR tools, namely, Eureqa and TuringBot and find that using these SR tools in conjunction with LGGA results in them solving up to 30% more equations, needing only a fraction of the amount of data compared to the same tool without LGGA, i.e., resulting in up to a 61.9% improvement in data efficiency.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-129.AshokD.pdf,38951232,4-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D1-D,D,1,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-129

Existing methods generally utilize manually extracted features, which is very time-consuming and laborious, and use traditional classifiers for label prediction without considering specific music features. To tackle this issue, we propose the Melodic Phrase Attention Network (MPAN) for symbolic data-based music genre classification. Our model is trained in three steps: First, we adopt representation learning, instead of the traditional musical feature extraction method, to obtain a vectorized representation of the music pieces. Second, the music pieces are divided into several melodic phrases through melody segmentation. Finally, the Melodic Phrase Attention Network is designed according to music characteristics, to identify the reflection of each melodic phrase on the music genre, thereby generating more accurate predictions. Experimental results show that our proposed method is superior to baseline symbolic data-based music genre classification approaches, and has achieved significant performance improvements on two large datasets.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-144.LiL.pdf,,4-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D1-D,D,2,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-144

SA-149,Generating Adversarial yet Inconspicuous Patches with a Single Image,Jinqi Luo|Tao Bai|Jun Zhao,"Deep neural networks have been shown vulnerable to adversarial patches, where exotic patterns can result in model’s wrong prediction. Nevertheless, existing approaches to adversarial patch generation hardly consider the contextual consistency between patches and the image background, causing such patches to be easily detected by human observation. Additionally, these methods require a large amount of data for training, which is computationally expensive. To overcome these challenges, we propose an approach to generate adversarial yet inconspicuous patches with one single image. In our approach, adversarial patches are produced in a coarse-to-fine way with multiple scales of generators and discriminators. The selection of patch location is based on the perceptual sensitivity of victim models. Contextual information is encoded during the Min-Max training to make patches consistent with surroundings.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-149.LuoJ.pdf,,4-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D1-F,F,2,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-149
SA-156,Towards Extracting Graph Neural Network Models via Prediction Queries,Bang Wu|Shirui Pan|Xingliang Yuan,"Graph data has been widely used to represent data from various domain, e.g., social networks, recommendation system. With great power, the GNN models, usually as valuable properties of their owners, also become attractive targets of the adversary who covets to steal them. While existing works show that simple deep neural networks can be reproduced by so-called Model Extraction Attacks, how to extract a GNN model has not been explored. In this paper, we exploit the threat of model extraction attacks against GNN models. Unlike ordinary attacks which obtain model information via only the input-output query pairs, we utilize both the node queries and the graph structure to extract the GNNs. Furthermore, we consider the stealthiness of the attack and propose to generate legitimate queries so the extraction can be applied discreetly. We implement our attack by leveraging the responses of these queries, as well as other accessible knowledge, e.g., neighbor connectives of the queried nodes. By evaluating over three real-world datasets, our attack is shown to effectively produce a surrogate model with more than 80% equivalent predictions as the target model.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-156.WuB.pdf,,4-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D1-A,A,3,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-156

Therefore, we propose a WildfireNet that can predict the shape of the wildfire of the next day, when given historical wildfire profiles, elevation, and weather data. The motivation behind WildfireNet is to locate fires in a precise manner and be able to accurately predict upcoming fires. The model’s architecture was built in the inspiration of U-Net, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) commonly used in a biomedical image segmentation. Intersection over Union (IoU) and recall were calculated to measure the performance of the model. The model achieved an IoU score of 0.997 in the test set. Since the objective of the model is to predict upcoming fires, pixels that were labeled as fire but not on the previous days were extracted to calculate recall. In the test set, Wild-fireNet scored a recall of around 0.75 for fires that grew slowly. Overall, WildfireNet is a novel wildfire spread model and has the potential to be a tool to aid firefighters in their decision making.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-171.SungS.pdf,,4-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D1-B,B,4,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-171

SA-187,Deep Reinforcement Learning for a Dictionary Based Compression Schema,Keren Nivasch|Dana Shapira|Amos Azaria,"An increasingly important process of the internet age and the massive data era is file compression. One popular compression scheme, Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW), maintains a dictionary of previously seen strings. The dictionary is updated throughout the parsing process by adding new encountered substrings. Klein, Opalinsky and Shapira (2019) recently studied the option of selectively updating the LZW dictionary. They show that even inserting only a random subset of the strings into the dictionary does not adversely affect the compression ratio. Inspired by their approach, we propose a reinforcement learning based agent, RLZW, that decides when to add a string to the dictionary. The agent is first trained on a large set of data, and then tested on files it has not seen previously (i.e., the test set). We show that on some types of input data, RLZW outperforms the compression ratio of a standard LZW.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-187.NivaschK.pdf,38951234,4-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D1-E,E,4,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-187
SA-188,Improving the Performance-Compatibility Tradeoff with Personalized Objective Functions,Jonathan Martinez,"AI-systems that model and interact with their users can update their models over time to reflect new information and changes in the environment. Although these updates may improve the overall performance of the AI-system, they may actually hurt the performance with respect to individual users. Prior work has studied the tradeoff between improving the system's performance following an update and the compatibility of the updated system with prior user experience. The more the model is forced to be compatible with a prior version, the higher loss in performance it will incur. This paper shows that that by personalizing the loss function to specific users, it is possible to increase the prediction performance of the AI-system while sacrificing less compatibility for these users following an update to improve the system's performance. Our approach updates the  sample weights  to reflect their contribution to the compatibility of the model for a particular user following the update. We construct a portfolio of different models that vary in how they personalize the loss function for a target user and then select  the  best model to use based on a validation set. We use a model selection algorithm to choose the best model from the portfolio for each user given a set of features that reflect the users' characteristics and performance of the different models on a training set. We apply this approach to three supervised learning tasks commonly used in the human-computer decision-making literature. We show that using our approach leads to significant improvements in the performance-compatibility tradeoff  over the  non-personalized approach of Bansal et al., achieving up to 300% improvement for certain users.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-188.MartinezJ.pdf,,4-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D1-F,F,4,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-188

Adversarial training or network training based data augmentation shows the potential to increase the adversarial robustness. While the training seems compelling, it is not feasible for resource-constrained institutions, especially academia, to train the network from scratch multiple times. The two fold contributions are: (i) providing an effective solution against white-box adversarial attacks via network fine-tuning steps and (ii) observing the role of different optimizers towards robustness. Extensive experiments are performed on a range of databases, including Fashion-MNIST and a subset of ImageNet.

However, generalization is also highly relevant to performance in these games, though model comparisons at large training timescales can be difficult. In this work, we address this by introducing a novel model trained using a sleep metaphor on a reduced complexity version of the Hanabi game. This sleep metaphor consists an altered training regiment, as well as an information-theoretic constraint on the agent's policy. Results from experimentation demonstrate improved performance through this sleep-metaphor method, and provide a promising motivation for using similar techniques in more complex methods that incorporate explicit models of other agent's beliefs.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-206.MalloyT.pdf,,5-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D2-C,C,1,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-206

To minimize the cost of data collection, researchers often employ techniques such as crowdsourcing and web scraping. However, web data and human annotations are known to exhibit high margins of error, resulting in sizable amounts of incorrect labels. Poorly labeled training data can cause models to overfit to the noise distribution, crippling performance in real-world applications. In this work, we investigate the viability of using data augmentation in conjunction with semi-supervised learning to improve the label noise robustness of image classification models.

SA-213,Contextual Bandits with Delayed Feedback and Semi-supervised Learning,Luting Yang|Jianyi Yang|Shaolei Ren,"Contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) is a classic online learning problem, where a learner/agent selects actions (i.e., arms) given contextual information and discovers optimal actions based on reward feedback. Applications of contextual bandit have been increasingly expanding, including advertisement, personalization, resource allocation in wireless networks, among others. Nonetheless, the reward feedback is delayed in many applications (e.g., a user may only provide service ratings after a period of time), creating challenges for contextual bandits. In this paper, we address delayed  feedback in contextual bandits by using semi-supervised learning — incorporate estimates of delayed rewards to improve the estimation of future rewards. Concretely,  the reward feedback for an arm selected at the beginning of a round is only observed by the agent/learner with some observation noise and provided to the agent after some a priori unknown but bounded delays. Motivated by  semi-supervised learning that produces pseudo labels for unlabeled data to further improve the  model performance, we generate fictitious estimates of rewards that are delayed and have yet to arrive based on already-learnt reward functions. Thus, by combining semi-supervised learning with online contextual bandit learning, we propose a novel extension and design two algorithms, which estimate the values for currently unavailable reward feedbacks to minimize the maximum estimation error and average estimation error, respectively.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-213.YangL.pdf,,5-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D2-F,F,1,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-213

Gromov's hyperbolicity measures whether a graph can be isometrically embedded in hyperbolic space. This paper shows that adversarial attacks that perturb the network structure also affect the hyperbolicity of graphs rendering hyperbolic space less effective for learning low-dimensional node embeddings of the graph. To circumvent this problem, we introduce learning embeddings in pseudo-Riemannian manifolds such as Lorentzian manifolds and show empirically that they are robust to adversarial perturbations.

Then it will encode the user post and graphs with a co-attention mechanism, which effectively encodes complex related data.

While MTL can improve task performance overall relative to single-task learning (STL), these improvements can hide negative transfer (NT), where STL may deliver better performance for many individual tasks. Asymmetric multi-task feature learning (AMTFL) is an approach that tries to address this by allowing tasks with higher loss values to have smaller influence on feature representations for learning other tasks. Task loss values do not necessarily indicate reliability of models for a specific task. We present examples of NT in two orthogonal datasets (image recognition and pharmacogenomics) and tackle this challenge by using aleatoric homoscedastic uncertainty to capture the relative confidence between tasks, and set weights for task loss.

Toward that goal, this paper describes a method that uses input from a tablet tutor’s user-facing camera to predict whether the student will complete the current activity or disengage from it. Training a disengagement predictor is useful not only in itself but also in identifying visual indicators of negative affective states even when they don’t lead to non-completion of the task. Unlike prior work that relied on tutor-specific features, the method relies solely on visual features and so could potentially apply to other tutors. We present a deep learning method to make such predictions based on a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model that uses a target replication loss function. We train and test the model on screen capture videos of children in Tanzania using a tablet tutor to learn basic Swahili literacy and numeracy.

These services often use different machine learning techniques for which fairness is a concerning factor, especially when the downstream services have the ability to cause social ramifications. Thus, focusing on the non-personalised (global) recommendations in news media platforms (e.g., top-k trending topics on Twitter, top-k news on a news platform, etc.), we discuss on two specific fairness concerns together (traditionally studied separately)---user fairness and organisational fairness. While user fairness captures the idea of representing the choices of all the individual users in the case of global recommendations, organisational fairness tries to ensure politically/ideologically balanced recommendation sets. This makes user fairness a user-side requirement and organisational fairness a platform-side requirement. For user fairness, we test with methods from social choice theory, i.e., various voting rules known to better represent user choices in their results. Even in our application of voting rules to the recommendation setup, we observe high user satisfaction scores. Now for organisational fairness, we propose a bias metric which measures the aggregate ideological bias of a recommended set of items (articles). Analysing the results obtained from voting rule-based recommendation, we find that while the well-known voting rules are better from the user side, they show high bias values and clearly not suitable for organisational requirements of the platforms. Thus, there is a need to build an encompassing mechanism by cohesively bridging ideas of user fairness and organisational fairness.

It is known that accuracy and diversity can be conflicting goals and finding appropriate ways to combine them is still an open research question. Several ways have been proposed to measure the diversity of recommendations and to include its optimization in the loss function used to train the model. Methods optimizing list based diversity suffer from two drawbacks: the high computational cost of the loss function and the lack of an efficient way to optimize them.

SA-309,EC-GAN: Low-Sample Classification using Semi-Supervised Algorithms and GANs,Ayaan Haque,"Semi-supervised learning has been gaining attention as it allows for performing image analysis tasks such as classification with limited labeled data. Some popular algorithms using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for semi-supervised classification share a single architecture for classification and discrimination. However, this may require a model to converge to a separate data distribution for each task, which may reduce overall performance. While progress in semi-supervised learning has been made, less addressed are small-scale, fully-supervised tasks where even unlabeled data is unavailable and unattainable. We therefore, propose a novel GAN model namely External Classifier GAN (EC-GAN), that utilizes GANs and semi-supervised algorithms to improve classification in fully-supervised regimes. Our method leverages a GAN to generate artificial data used to supplement supervised classification. More specifically, we attach an external classifier, hence the name EC-GAN, to the GAN’s generator, as opposed to sharing an architecture with the discriminator. Our experiments demonstrate that EC-GAN's performance is comparable to the shared architecture method, far superior to the standard data augmentation and regularization-based approach, and effective on a small, realistic dataset.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-309.HaqueA.pdf,38951242,6-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D3-B,B,3,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-309

While the entertainment impact in terms of lives that Bollywood can potentially touch is mammoth, no NLP study on social biases in Bollywood content exists. We thus seek to understand social biases in a developing country through the lens of popular movies.

But recent work has also demonstrated that these deep neural networks are very vulnerable to adversarial examples (adversarial examples - inputs to a model which are naturally similar to original data but fools the model in classifying it into a wrong class). In this work, we proposed a novel method to train deep learning models on an image classification task. We used a reward-based optimization function, similar to the vanilla policy gradient method in reinforcement learning to train our model instead of conventional cross-entropy loss. An empirical evaluation on cifar10 dataset showed that our method outperforms the same model architecture trained using cross-entropy loss function (on adversarial training). At the same time, our method generalizes better to the training data with the difference in test accuracy and train accuracy < 2% for most of the time as compared to cross-entropy one, whose difference most of the time remains > 2%.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-372.GuptaSK.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-A,A,1,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-372

It handles the state uncertainty by specifying the probability of getting a particular observation given the current state. DESPOT is one of the most popular scalable online planning algorithms for POMDPs, which manages to significantly reduce the size of the decision tree while deriving a near-optimal policy by considering only $K$ scenarios. Nevertheless, there is a gap in action selection criteria between planning and execution in DESPOT. During the planning stage, it keeps choosing the action with the highest upper bound, whereas when the planning ends, the action with the highest lower bound is chosen for execution. Here, we propose LB-DESPOT to alleviate this issue, which utilizes the lower bound in selecting an action branch to expand. Empirically, our method has attained better performance than DESPOT and POMCP, which is another state-of-the-art, on several challenging POMDP benchmark tasks.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-374.WuC.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-B,B,1,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-374
SA-375,Improving the Morphology and Control Policy of Self-reconfiguring Modular Robots in Dynamic Environment,Dong Xue|Qiang Lu|Jian Li,"Ideally, self-reconfiguration modular robots (SMR) can change their morphology and perform actions related to a specific task in any scene. However, most SMRs only adapt to several specific scenes because their morphology and control policies are designed or trained based on these scenes. Once SMRs meet an unknown scene, especially multiply unknown scenes (called dynamic environment), these policies will be useless. Although some of these policies import evolutionary algorithms to enhance the ability of SMR to explore unknown scenes, they are very time-consuming. The reason is that individual fitness depends on the interaction between SMR and these scenes. We propose a two-stage reconfiguration algorithm (TSRA) without any prior knowledge to address the time-consuming problem. In the two stages, the reconfiguration methods use the evolutionary algorithm (GA) to simultaneously generate scene-fitted morphology and actions. The first stage method uses the estimation neural network to evaluate the individual fitness to run faster and can recommend better policies to the second stage. The second stage method obtains this fitness from scenes and updates the neural network to approximate these scenes. Through experiments, TSRA can find better morphology and control policies than the other two canonical algorithms --- GA and GEM-RL.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-375.XueD.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-C,C,1,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-375

To solve the above problems, in this paper, we first propose a fixed threshold method based on the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) lexicon to decide whether to change a word, which keeps the fluency of the original LM to the greatest extent. Furthermore, for the improvement of sentiment alignment, we propose a dynamic threshold method that utilizes VAD-based loss to make the threshold dynamic. Experiments demonstrate that our methods outperform the baseline with a great margin significantly both on fluency and sentiment accuracy.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-400.XuC.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-C,C,3,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-400
SA-403,Enhancing Context-Based Meta-Reinforcement Learning Algorithms via An Efficient Task Encoder,Feng Xu|Shengyi Jiang|Hao Yin|Zongzhang Zhang|Yang Yu|Ming Li|Dong Li|Wulong Liu,"Meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL) algorithms enable agents to adapt to new tasks from small amounts of exploration, based on the experience of similar tasks. Recent studies have pointed out that a good representation of a task is key to the success of off-policy context-based meta-RL. Inspired by contrastive methods in unsupervised representation learning, we propose a new method to learn the task representation based on the mutual information between transition tuples in a trajectory and the task embedding. We also propose a new estimation for task similarity based on Q-function, which can be used to form a constraint on the distribution of the encoded task variables, making the task encoder encode the task variables more effective on new tasks. Experiments on meta-RL tasks show that the newly proposed method outperforms existing meta-RL algorithms.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-403.XuF.pdf,38951250,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-D,D,3,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-403
SA-406,State-Wise Adaptive Discounting from Experience (SADE): A Novel Discounting Scheme for Reinforcement Learning,Milan Zinzuvadiya|Vahid Behzadan,"In Markov Decision Process (MDP) models of sequential decision-making, it is common practice to account for temporal discounting by incorporating a constant discount factor. While the effectiveness of fixed-rate discounting in various Reinforcement Learning (RL) settings is well-established, the efficiency of this scheme has been questioned in recent studies.  Another notable shortcoming of fixed-rate discounting stems from abstracting away the experiential information of the agent, which is shown to be a significant component of delay discounting in human cognition. To address this issue, we propose State-wise Adaptive Discounting from Experience (SADE) as a novel adaptive discounting scheme for RL agents. SADE leverages the experiential observations of state values in episodic trajectories to iteratively adjust state-specific discount rates. We report experimental evaluations of SADE in Q-learning agents, which demonstrate significant enhancement of sample complexity and convergence rate compared to fixed-rate discounting.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-406.ZinzuvadiyaM.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-E,E,3,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-406
SA-407,Reward based Hebbian Learning in Direct Feedback Alignment,Ashlesha Akella|Sai Kalyan Ranga Singanamalla|Chin-Teng Lin,"Imparting biological realism during the learning process is gaining attention towards producing computationally efficient algorithms without compromising the performance. Feedback alignment and mirror neuron concept are two such approaches where the feedback weight remains static in the former and update via Hebbian learning in the later. Though these approaches have proven to work efficiently for supervised learning, it remained unknown if the same can be applicable to reinforcement learning applications. Therefore, this study introduces RHebb-DFA where the reward-based Hebbian learning is used to update feedback weights in direct feedback alignment mode. This approach is validated on various Atari games and obtained equivalent performance in comparison with DDQN.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-407.AkellaA.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-F,F,3,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-407

A common practice in designing those systems is through intent classification. However, in a multiple-stage task commonly seen in those settings, relying solely on intent classification may lead to erroneous answers, as questions rising from different work stages may share the same intent but have different contexts and therefore require different answers. To address this problem, we designed an interactive dialogue system that utilizes contextual information to assist intent classification in a multiple-stage task. Specifically, our system incorporates user’s utterances with real-time video feed to better situate users’ questions and analyze their intent.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-411.ChiuYC.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-A,A,4,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-411
SA-413,Evaluating Meta-Reinforcement Learning through a HVAC Control Benchmark,Yashvir Singh Grewal|Frits de Nijs|Sarah Goodwin,"Meta-Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms promise to leverage prior task experience to quickly learn new unseen tasks. Unfortunately, evaluating meta-RL algorithms is complicated by a lack of suitable benchmarks. In this paper we propose adapting a challenging real-world heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) control benchmark for meta-RL. Unlike existing benchmark problems, HVAC control has a broader task distribution, and sources of exogenous stochasticity from price and weather predictions which can be shared across task definitions. This can enable greater differentiation between the performance of current meta-RL approaches, and open the way for future research into algorithms that can adapt to entirely new tasks not sampled from the current task distribution.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-413.GrewalYS.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-B,B,4,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-413

However, the existing approaches do not take into account the inference capabilities of ontology languages that are based on expressive description logic (such as OWL 2). To fill this gap, we propose two approaches: an ontology-based embedding model for theories in  EL++ description logic and a reinforcement learning-based solution for efficient tableau-based reasoning on description logic. We describe promising initial results of our efforts towards these directions and lay down the direction for future work.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-414.SinghG.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-C,C,4,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-414
SA-416,NEAP-F: Network Epoch Accuracy Prediction Framework,Arushi Chauhan|Mayank Vatsa|Richa Singh,"Recent work in neural architecture search has spawned interest in algorithms that can predict the performance of convolutional neural networks using minimum time and computation resources. We propose a new framework, Network Epoch Accuracy Prediction Framework (NEAP-F) which can predict the testing accuracy achieved by a convolutional neural network in one or more epochs. We introduce a novel approach to generate vector representations for networks, and encode ``ease"" of classifying image datasets into a vector. For vector representations of networks, we focus on the layer parameters and connections between the network layers. A network achieves different accuracies on different image datasets; therefore, we use the image dataset characteristics to create a vector signifying the ``ease"" of classifying the image dataset. After generating these vectors, the prediction models are trained with architectures having skip connections seen in current state-of-the-art architectures. The framework predicts accuracies in order of milliseconds, demonstrating its computational efficiency. It can be easily applied to neural architecture search methods to predict the performance of candidate networks and can work on unseen datasets as well.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-416.ChauhanA.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-D,D,4,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-416
SA-417,Shallow-UWnet: Compressed Model for Underwater Image Enhancement,Ankita Naik|Apurva Swarnakar|Kartik Mittal,"Over the past few decades, underwater image enhancement has attracted an increasing amount of research effort due to its significance in underwater robotics and ocean engineering. Research has evolved from implementing physics-based solutions to using very deep CNNs and GANs. However, these state-of-art algorithms are computationally expensive and memory intensive. This hinders their deployment on portable devices for underwater exploration tasks. These models are trained on either synthetic or limited real-world datasets making them less practical in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a shallow neural network architecture, Shallow-UWnet which maintains performance and has fewer parameters than the state-of-art models. We also demonstrated the generalization of our model by benchmarking its performance on a combination of synthetic and real-world datasets.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-417.NaikA.pdf,38951251,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-E,E,4,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-417
SA-418,Semi-Supervised Learning via Triplet Network Based Active Learning,Divyanshu Sundriyal|Soumyadeep Ghosh|Mayank Vatsa|Richa Singh,"In recent years, deep learning models have pushed state-of-the-art accuracies for several machine learning tasks. However, such models require a large amount of (supervised) data for training. While unlabelled data is available in abundance, manually labeling them is very costly. Active learning techniques helps in utilizing unlabelled data which may result in an improved classification model. In this research, we present an active learning algorithm which can help in increasing performance of deep learning models by using large amount of unlabelled data. A novel active learning algorithm, Triplet AL is proposed which uses a triplet network to select samples from an unlabelled data set. Previous active learning methods rely on classification model's final prediction scores as a measure of confidence for an unlabelled sample. We propose a more reliable confidence measure, termed as Top-Two-Margin which is given by the Triplet Network. The proposed algorithm shows improved performance compared to other active learning approaches.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-418.SundriyalD.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-F,F,4,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-418
SA-421,Text Embedding Bank for Detailed Image Paragraph Captioning,Arjun Gupta|Zack Shen|Thomas Huang,"Existing deep learning-based models for image captioning typically consist of an image encoder to extract visual features and a language model decoder, an architecture that has shown promising results in single high-level sentence generation. However, only the word-level guiding signal is available when the image encoder is optimized to extract visual features. The inconsistency between the parallel extraction of visual features and sequential text supervision limits its success when the length of the generated text is long (more than 50 words). We propose a new module, called the Text Embedding Bank (TEB), to address this problem for image paragraph captioning. This module uses the paragraph vector model to learn fixed-length feature representations from a variable-length paragraph. We refer to the fixed-length feature as the TEB. This TEB module plays two roles to benefit paragraph captioning performance. First, it acts as a form of global and coherent deep supervision to regularize visual feature extraction in the image encoder. Second, it acts as a distributed memory to provide features of the whole paragraph to the language model, which alleviates the long-term dependency problem. Adding this module to two existing state-of-the-art methods achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the paragraph captioning Stanford Visual Genome dataset.",https://www.aaai.org/AAAI21Papers/SA-421.GuptaA.pdf,,7-Feb,,,,H,,SA-D4-A,A,5,Student Abstracts,http://widget1.virtualchair.net/custom/aaai/jump?paperId=SA-421
SA-436,Zera-Shot Sentiment Analysis for Code-Mixed Data,Siddharth Yadav|Tanmoy Chakraborty,Code-mixing is the practice of alternating between two or more languages. A major part of sentiment analysis research has been monolingual and they perform poorly on the code-mixed text. We introduce methods that use multilingual and cross-lingual embeddings to transfer knowledge from monolingual text to code-mixed text for code-mixed sentiment analysis. Our methods handle code-mixed text through zero-shot learning and beat state-of-the-art English-Spanish code-mixed sentiment analysis by an absolute 3% F1-score. We are able to achieve 0.58 F1-score (without a parallel corpus) and  0.62 F1-score (with the parallel corpus) on the same benchmark in a zero-shot way as compared to 0.68 F1-score in supervised settings.
